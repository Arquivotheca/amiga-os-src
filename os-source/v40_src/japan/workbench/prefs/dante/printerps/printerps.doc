         PrinterPS - The PostScript Printer Driver Preferences Editor
         ============================================================

PrinterPS lets the user set several options controlling how text and graphics
are to be output on a PostScript printer. The following explains what each
option available does.

PrinterPS is not fully implemented:

   - All numeric entry gadgets are currently not being handled.
   - The "Sample Scalings" images are not currently being adapted to the
     scaling type
   - The "Measuring System" menu selection currently does nothing

Everything else should be fully functional.


Driver Mode
-----------
Lets you select between "PostScript" or "Pass Through". The "PostScript" mode
will cause the driver to convert any text output sent to it to "PostScript"
and send the results over to the printer. The "Pass Through" option will force
the driver to leave the data alone and send it directly to the printer. The
"Pass Through" option lets programs that output PostScript directly function
correctly by sending their PostScript code directly to the printer and not
treating it as a text file.

Copies
------
This specifies the number of copies of each page to print, from 1 to 99.

Paper Type
----------
A cycle gadget with "Single" or "Continuous" as options.

Paper Format
------------
Lets the user select between "U.S. Letter", "U.S. Legal", "DIN A4" and
"Custom". This defines the size of the paper being used. Clicking on this
gadget sets the values in the "Paper Width" and "Paper Height" cycle gadget to
match what the format dictates.

Paper Width and Paper Height
----------------------------
These let you specify the exact paper dimensions being used. These gadgets are
ghosted unless the "Paper Format" gadget is set to "Custom".

Horizontal DPI and Vertical DPI
-------------------------------
Lets you specify the dots per inch to use in the printout. The driver will
assume that DPI for all of its dithering and other processing.

Panel Cycle Gadget
------------------
This lets you select which of the four additional option panel is currently
displayed. The four panels are "Text Options", "Text Dimensions", "Graphics
Options", and "Graphics Dimensions". The panel selected determines which
of the following gadgets is displayed. The reason to use gadget panels is due
to lack of space in a 640x200 resolution display.

Font
----
This lets you select which font to use in printout. These are built-in printer
fonts and are used whenever text is sent to the printer.

Pitch
-----
Lets you select either "Normal", "Compressed", or "Expanded" print faces.

Orientation
-----------
Lets you select between "Portrait" or "Landscape" printing. Landscape printing
is useful for things like envelopes.

Tab
---
Lets you specify how to handle tabs in the printed file. The available
selections are "4 characters", "8 characters", "1/4 Inch", "1/2 Inch", and
"1 Inch". The inch settings are useful when printing with a proportional
font.

Margin Gadgets
--------------
Lets you specify all four margins for text printing. The values entered are
relative to the left/top edge of the paper as well as to the paper's width
and height values specified previously.

Font Point Size
---------------
Lets you specify the size of the font to use whenever text is sent to the
printer.

Line Leading
------------
Lets you specify the amount of leading betweens printed lines of text. Leading
is the distance between the tops of two adjacent lines.

Lines Per Inch
--------------
This text display area shows the number of lines per inch which is calculated
based on the values of the "Font Point Size" and "Line Leading".

Lines Per Page
--------------
This text display area shows the number of lines per inch which is calculated
based on the values of the "Font Point Size", "Line Leading", "Paper Height",
"Top Margin", and "Bottom Margin".

Edge Dimension Gadgets
----------------------
Similar to the four Margin gadgets, but used for graphics printing.

Shading
-------
Lets you select between "Black & White", "Grey Scale", and "Color".

Dithering
---------
*** need to explain this

Transparency
------------
*** need to explain this

Aspect
------
When printing graphics, this lets you specify whether the picture should be
printed normally, or sideways. This is the first operation done on a graphics,
it happens before the scaling.

Scaling Type
------------
Lets you select one of 7 scaling types. All types control how the picture
is printed within the user specified printing region.

  1 - No scaling. This prints the picture as is. The picture may be clipped on
  the right and bottom edges to fit within the print region specified.

  2 - Aspect preserving scale with horizontal bias. This makes the horizontal
  dimension as wide as the print region, and scales the vertical dimension
  by whatever is needed to preserve the aspect ratio. The vertical dimension
  is clipped to the print region if it gets too tall.

  3 - Aspect preserving scale with vertical bias. This makes the vertical
  dimension as tall as the print region, and scales the horizontal dimension
  by whatever is needed to preserve the aspect ratio. The horizontal dimension
  is clipped to the print region if it gets too wide.

  4 - Aspect preserving maximum scale. This makes the picture as big as
  possible while ensuring it fits in the print region and preserves its
  aspect ratio.

  5 - Aspect insensitive scale with no bias. This makes the picture take
  up the emtire print region in both dimensions and will distort the aspect
  ratio if needed.

  6 - Aspect insensitive scale with horizontal bias. This makes the horizontal
  dimension as wide as the print region, and scales the vertical dimension
  by whatever is needed to preserve the aspect ratio, or until the vertical
  dimension gets as tall as the print region. The difference between this
  type and type #2 is that the vertical dimension is made to always fit
  within the print region instead of being clipped.

  7 - Aspect insensitive scale with vertical bias. This makes the vertical
  dimension as tall as the print region, and scales the horizontal dimension
  by whatever is needed to preserve the aspect ratio, or until the horizontal
  dimension gets as wide as the print region. The difference between this
  type and type #3 is that the horizontal dimension is made to always fit
  within the print region instead of being clipped.

Scaling Math
------------
Determines whether "Integer" or "Fractional" math is to be used during scaling
operations.

Centering
---------
This lets you specify no centering, horizontal centering, vertical centering,
or both horizontal and vertical. The centering operation is performed last
in the printing process, after the scaling.

Scaling Samples
---------------
These show a sample picture being scaled to various target sizes. Selecting
different scaling types changes the samples to reflect what would happen on
the printed page.
