We basically support pure JIS double-byte code set.

(1) AMIGA/OS does not understand single-byte KATAKANA.

    If you use single-byte KATAKANA in Shift-JIS, you have to convert to
    double-byte KATAKANA in EUC.
    If you use conversion tool which name is "JISConvert" we support,
    this program automatically convert from single-byte KATAKANA in Shift-JIS
    to double-byte KATAKANA in EUC.


(2) You have to make sure that you use only pure JIS (JIS X 9051)

    You can't use GAIJI characters you created with another machine.
    And also you can't use some special characters that JIS does not have.
    For example, if you use PC98-SYMBOL (Shift-JIS code from "0x8540" to "0x879c")
    or PC98-EXTEND (Shift-JIS code from "0xed40" to "0xeefc"), it is no guarantee
    for "JISConvert" to convert characters you expect.
    Also it is same thing for some codes in DOS/V like Shift-JIS "0xfa56".
