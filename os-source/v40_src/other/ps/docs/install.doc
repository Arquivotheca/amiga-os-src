Amiga Postscript Installation information.
------------------------------------------

For this internal release, Postscript consists of a small bootstrap program
called "PS" which opens the Postscript.library which should live in LIBS: .
You will need an Amiga with an 881/2 and at least one meg of RAM.

To install postscript:

1. Copy postscript.library to the libs: directory
2. Copy /usr/commodore/amiga/V/src/other/ps/aps to a directory
   on your hard disk.
3. Assign PS: to this directory

All Postscript interpreters actually initialize themselves partially using
Postscript operators and procedures. PS therefore needs to be passed this
initialization file ("sl.ps") as an argument.

To start Postscript up therefore:

    1> cd ps:
    1> ps sl.ps

Sl.ps itself is just a small postscript program which loads other logically
independent Postscript initialization modules.
These modules/files are:

    - ps:fonts.ps   (initialize font dictionary)
    - ps:init.ps    (initialize systemdict)
    - ps:err.ps     (initialize error handling mechanism)

All these files should live in a logical directory called "PS:".

If fonts are to be used, all font files need to be present in PS: too.
Currently the only fonts available are:

	- Times-Roman	(whole 32..255 range)
	- Helvetica		(upto ASCII 127 only)
	- Courier		(		""			)
	- Schoolbook	(		""			)

WARNING: these files have been reverse engineered from data extracted from a
true Adobe Postscript laser printer and should therefore not be spread beyond
Commodore Engineering.

To execute any of the postscript programs in ps: simply type

    "(filename.ps) run"

at the APS> prompt.  If you run "demo.ps" you can view the demos simply by
typing a number followed by demo.

Since save/restore is not implemented, everything you do in PostScript will
continually consume memory.  You should quit the interpreter (with quit) and
start it up again if memory use gets too bad.
