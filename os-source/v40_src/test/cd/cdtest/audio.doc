  Before executing this script, you need to run two instances of the program
"CDTest."  Do this by typing "RUN CDTEST" twice, within your cli shell.
Also, be sure you are using an audio CD with this script.

  Audio.cd is an arexx script that contains commands provided by the
"host environment" of CDTest.

  Its purpose is to test all audio aspects of cd.device on the Amiga CD32.


The individual tests include:

  Table of Contents (TOC):
  - Lists Track information from the summary and without the summary.

  Audio Play (LSN):
  - Plays various segments of music via the LSN format.
    NOTE:  LSN = Logical Sector Number

  Audio Play (MSF):
  - Plays various segments of music via the MSF format.
    NOTE:  MSF = Minutes/Seconds/Frames

  Audio Play (Track):
  - Plays first and last, and finally, all the tracks on the disk.

  Audio Play (Search):
  - Engages the search modes during audio play.

  Audio Pause:
  - Engages the pause feature during audio play.
  *** This test requires "AudioPause.rexx" to be within the same directory.

  Attenuate:
  - Attempts to fade the music in and out.
  *** This test requires "AudioPlay.rexx" to be within the same directory.
    NOTE:  Fading does not occur on the current Amiga CD32 system.
           CD.Device should ignore the ATTENUATE commands.

  Q-Code:
  - Stores Q-Codes during audio play and displays them upon completion
    of audio play.
  *** This test requires "AudioPlay.rexx" to be within the same directory.

  Frame Interrupt:
  - Adds a frame interrupt to verify calls to the frame interrupt handler.
    It also checks for bad interrupt data.


NOTE:  The menu options let you pick and choose which tests you would
       like to perform.

       If you are experiencing problems with the PLAY command, it is most
       likely due to lack of memory available.
       Reboot and make another attempt.
