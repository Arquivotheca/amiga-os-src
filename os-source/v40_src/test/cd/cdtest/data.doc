  Before executing this script, you need to run two instances of the program
"CDTest."  Do this by typing "RUN CDTEST" twice, within your cli shell.
Also, be sure you are using an audio CD with this script.

  Data.cd is an arexx script that contains commands provided by the
"host environment" of CDTest.

  Its purpose is to test all data aspects of cd.device on the CD32.


The individual tests include:

  Read:
  - Reads various lengths of data from the file "OFFSET."

  Read Speed:
  - Reads 512KB of data at 75KB/Sec (normal speed) and 150KB/Sec.

  Drive Geometry:
  - Outputs drive geometry.

  CD-ROM Recognition:
  - Gives disk/drive information for various requested disks.

  Protection Status:
  - Reports whether or not the CD-ROM is write-protected.

  Audio Commands during I/O:
  - Performs various play functions while data is being read.
  *** This test requires "DataPlay.rexx" to be within the same directory.

  Table of Contents (TOC):
  - Lists track information from the summary and without the summary.


NOTE:  The menu options let you pick and choose which tests you would
       like to perform.

       If you are experiencing problems with the READ command, it is most
       likely due to lack of memory available.
       Reboot and make another attempt.
