   NAME
	SetAlert                                                  Requires 2.04

   SYNOPSIS
	SetAlert - A tool to let you set the Alert TimeOut in V39 and later
	system releases.

   FUNCTION
	As of V39, EXEC alerts are able to timeout and that timeout can
	be set.  This timeout also survives reboots as best as possible.
	SetAlert can also be used to determine what the current setting is.
	SetAlert can be used from the Workbench and the options can be
	stored in the tooltypes of the icon.

   INPUTS
	SECONDS/N    Number of seconds that alerts should remain visible
	NONE/S       Alerts should never be displayed
	FOREVER/S    Alerts should not timeout
	QUIET/S      Do not display status information

   RESULTS
	The alert timeout will be set as asked for and the setting will
	be displayed unless the QUIET option is used.

   NOTES
	The alert timeout is actualy a count of VBlanks that the alert is
	displayed.  SetAlert will try to convert this value as best as
	possible to seconds by using the VBlank frequency stored in
	EXEC.  This is the default VBlank frequency and if the alert
	happens to show up in a different display frequency from that
	default the delay will be slightly different.

	A delay of 0 means never display the alert
