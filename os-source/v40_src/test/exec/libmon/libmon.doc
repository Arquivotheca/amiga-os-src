                          A Library Monitoring Tool
                              by J.W. Lockhart

VERSION
    This document is current for LibMon 2.8 27 May 1993
    $VER: LibMon_doc 2.2 (27.05.93)

PURPOSE
    Monitor calls to OpenLibrary() and CloseLibrary(), using KPrintF() to
    report.  Can also fail OpenLibrary() calls for specific libraries.

FUNCTION
    When you start LibMon, it SetFunctions OpenLibrary, and will
    print the requested library, version, and the caller's 
    process or task name to the serial port at 9600 baud.
    If SegTracker is present, segment info will be included in
    all reports.
    
    To turn it off, just run it again with the Quit option.  

    To modify the list of libraries that will be monitored/ignored/denied,
    invoke LibMon additional times, using the options below.
    
USAGE
    LibMon [lib <librariess>] [only] [ignore] [deny] [stet] [list] [quit]


TEMPLATE
    LIB=LIBS/K/M, ONLY=ADD/S, IGNORE=DEL/S, DENY/S, STET=NOLOWER/S, LIST/S,
    QUIT/S

OPTIONS
   [NONE] - Report on open/close of all libraries.  This is also what you get
            if you launch LibMon from Workbench.
    LIBS  - The libraries in question.
    ADD   - Pay attention to these libraries, or add them to the
            report/ignore/deny list.
    DEL   - Ignore these libraries, or remove them from the report/ignore/deny
            list.
    DENY  - Fail any OpenLibrary() for these libraries.  Only applies to
            an empty list, or on initial invocation.
    STET  - Do not convert library names to lower case.
    LIST  - tell what type of list is being used, and list its contents.
            This option has no effect on the initial invocation of LibMon
            (the "server").
    QUIT  - terminate program

    You may specify only one of ADD, DEL, DENY.
    If you specify LIBS but not ADD, DEL, or DENY, LibMon assumes ADD.
    Please note that options are interpreted differently depending on whether
    LibMon is already running.  Consistency is attempted, but being explicit 
    can mean being understood :-)

    LibMon keeps only one type of list at any time.  You may ADD or DELete
    items from it, but you may not change the type of the list unless the
    list is empty.  Thus, the DENY option only works on startup, or when
    the list is empty.

DEFAULTS
    If run with no args:
       Reports opens/closes of all libraries.  
    If run only with LIBS:
       Reports only about those specific libraries.  Names are put in lowercase.
    If the Ignore/Only/Deny list becomes empty, LibMon will revert to
    reporting on all libraries.  At this point, you may change the list
    type by specifying more libraries and one of the ONLY, IGNORE, or DENY
    options.


EXAMPLES
     1.  Using LibMon to Monitor Only Certain Libraries
           libmon libs intuition.library graphics.library only
           --> reports about opens/closes of graphics and intuition
           libmon libs gadtools.library add
           --> also reports about opens/closes of gadtools
           libmon libs graphics.library del
           --> now only reports on intuition and gadtools
           libmon libs utility.library deny
           --> error message, no changes.
           libmon libs intuition.library gadtools.library del
           --> now reports on all libraries
           libmon libs utility.library deny
           --> now denies all opens of utility.library

     2.  Using LibMon to Ignore Only Certain Libraries
           libmon libs dos.library ignore
           --> reports on all libraries except for dos
           libmon libs exec.library add
           --> reports on everything but dos and exec
           libmon libs dos.library del
           --> reports on everything but exec

     3.  Using LibMon to Deny Access to Only Certain Libraries
           libmon libs gadtools.library deny
           --> fails all opens of gadtools (all versions)
           libmon libs utility.library add
           --> fails all opens of gadtools and utility (all versions)
           libmon libs gadtools.library utility.library del
           --> removes all openlibrary restrictions.
         In Denial Mode, all OpenLibrary()/CloseLibrary attempts are reported.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (SegTracker present)
    O: dos.library V0 (v: 40) (c: 24) (t: font)
       (a: $00F960F8) (s: ) (h: $0000) (o: $00000000)
        Translation:  OpenLibrary("dos.library",0) happened.  Library was opened,
        its version was 40, and the open count is 24.  The task that caused this
        was "font", from address F960F8, Segment Unknown, Hunk Unknown, Offset Unknown.
    C: dos.library (v: 40) (c: 23) (t: font)
       (a: $00F96100) (s: ) (h: $0000) (o: $00000000)
        Translation: CloseLibrary(DOSBase), with much the same info as above.
    D: intuition.library V38 (v: -1) (c: -1) (t: font)
       (a: $07898416) (s: font) (h: $0000) (o: $000007FE)
        Translation: OpenLibrary("intuition.library", 38) was attempted, but
        the open was denied.  Version/OpenCount aren't applicable.  The
        task was "font", from address $7898416, Segment owner "font",
        hunk 0, offset $7FE.

    Summary:
        O - OpenLibrary() 
        C - CloseLibrary()
        D - Denied OpenLibrary()
        v - version
        c - openCount
        t - task
        a - return address of caller
        These require SegTracker to work:
            s - segment executing under task
            h - hunk
            o - offset


RANDOM NOTES
    LibMon currently doesn't check to make sure that nobody else has
    SetFunctioned OpenLibrary, so be sure that LibMon was the last
    setfunctioner of OpenLibrary started before you terminate it.

    LibMon will cheat in Denial Mode and allow OpenLibrary() by
    all tasks/processes with the name LibMon (case-insensitive).

    LibMon swaps its stack, so as not to blow up when locale.library is
    present.  (Locale makes RawDoFmt() use more stack, which would otherwise
    cause LibMon to trash RAM when running on low-stack tasks such as RAM.)
    
    This program uses cback.o to detach itself.  Don't try "LibMon ?"...

    Although LibMon may be launched from Workbench, the options---INCLUDING
    the Quit option---may only be used from the CLI.

    LibMon swaps the stack in its new Open/Close- Library functions, so that
    locale.library won't cause KPrintF() to blow up.  Because it uses a 
    single ~20K stack for this, all Open/Close- Library()s are done under
    a Forbid().  Unfortunately, this can slow down the system...


HISTORY
    2.8 (27 May 1993) Major bugfixes.  2.1 wasn't doing list maintenance
                      correctly, nor was it handling CloseLibrary(NULL).
    2.1 (11 Apr 1993) Major enchancements and feature-creep.
    1.4 (30 Mar 1993) Initial offering.  Could stand a few enhancments.


FUTURE ENCHANCEMENTS
    May grow real Workbench support if there's sufficient demand and
    general bribes of beer & munchies :-)
