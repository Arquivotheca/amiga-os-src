PURPOSE
    Pops up any alert -- you can specify it by name (as in <exec/alerts.h>)
    or by hex number.  Also will examine or set ExecBase->LastAlert.
    Can also generate various crashes.

TEMPLATE 
    ALERT, LAST=LASTALERT/K/N, FATAL/S, CRASH/K/N, SHOWLAST/S

    ALERT      hex alert to pop (or name)
    LAST       new value for execbase's lastalert[3]
    FATAL      OR 0x8000000 to specified alert
    CRASH      generate specific crash (see below)
    SHOWLAST   just show what's in SysBase->LastAlert[]

    The Crash option takes a number:
        1 - calls graphics.library/WriteChunkyPixels() without having opened
            graphics.
        2 - adds one to Alert's Task->tc_SPReg
        3 - divides by zero
        4 - trashes stack

    Any undefined numbers default to the last one (highest numbered) on the
    list above.

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
    Displays usage.  Relatively harmless :-)
