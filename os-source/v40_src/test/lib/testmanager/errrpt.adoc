   NAME
      errRpt - log an error, progress, informational, or debugging message

   SYNOPSIS
      error = errRpt(ErrReport, errLevel, errType, errCode, fmt, arg1, ...)

      BYTE errRpt(struct errReport *, UWORD, BYTE, LONG, STRPTR, LONG, ...);

   FUNCTION
      Sends information off to test manager task.  This includes
      a string for the user to see, codes describing the problem,
      a code describing the severity of the problem (if any).

   INPUTS
      errReport- pointer to structure previously initialized by
                 initTstData().  If you pass NULL, no report will
                 be sent and you will receive RPT_NO_SERV back.
      errLevel - see common.h.  This describes what your message
                 means to the user:  error or progress report,
                 additional information, or even debugging information.
                 Currently defined values:
                    LVL_PROG for a progress report;
                    LVL_ERR  for an error message;
                    LVL_ERR2 for addtional error information;
                    LVL_VB1  for optional information (VB2 and VB3 as well);
                    LVL_DB1  for debugging information (DB2 and DB3 as well).
                 Note that LVL_ERR or LVL_ERR2 will cause the Test Manager
                 to display a "Test Failed!" message, with appropriate
                 bells and whistles.
      errType  - describes what errCode means.  
                    PROB_NONE   for no problem;
                    PROB_IOERR  for a standard IoErr()-type error code;
                    PROB_CUSTOM for a custom error code (strongly
                                discouraged!).
      errCode  - a numerical description of your problem.
      fmt      - printf-style formatting string of the type described
                 in exec.library/RawDoFmt().
      arg1     - first of the arguments to plug into the fmt string,
                 or NULL.

   RESULT
      error    - described in common.h.  If you get anything other
                 than RPT_OK back, you should exit immediately after
                 freeing your resources.  Other possible returns
                 are RPT_ABORT if the TestManager has requested that
                 you abort, or RPT_NO_SERV if the TestManager has
                 exited.  This permits cute games to be played,
                 but such practice is discouraged, especially if 
                 RPT_NO_SERV is encountered.

   EXAMPLE
      struct errReport *test;
      BYTE rc;
      int i;

      if (test = initTstData("MyTest",NULL)) {
         for (i = 0; i < MAX_TESTS; i++) {
           /* ... perform test... */
           if (test_ok) {
               /* report progress */
               rc = errRpt(test, LVL_PROG, PROB_NONE, NULL,
                       "Test %ld went OK\n", (LONG) i);
               if (rc != RPT_OK)
                  CleanUpAndExit(test); /* must freeTstData(test) ! */
           }
           else {
               /* report error */
               rc = errRpt(test, LVL_ERR, PROB_IOERR, IoErr(),
                       "Test %ld failed: %s\n", (LONG)i, MY_ERR_MSG);
               if (rc != RPT_OK)
                  CleanUpAndExit(test);  /* must freeTstData(test) ! */
           }
         }  
         freeTstData(test);
      }

   NOTES
      Messages are automatically time-stamped, identified, and
      reported according to the settings of the Test Manager.

   BUGS
      None yet.

   NAME
     freeTstData - free errReport created by initTstData()

   SYNOPSIS
     freeTstData(test)

     void freeTstData(struct errReport *test);

   FUNCTION
     Sends exit message to Test Manager, and
     frees all allocations made by initTstData().
     Message port is, of course, cleaned up properly.

   INPUTS
     test - struct errReport allocated by initTstData().
            Passing NULL is not an error; freeTstData will merely return
            without attempting to do anything.

   RESULT
     Exit message is sent, MsgPort is cleaned up and deleted, and
     all allocations made by initTstData() are freed.  Pointer passed in
     is no longer valid, and is set to NULL.

   EXAMPLE
      if (RPT_OK != errRpt(er, LVL_PROG, PROB_NONE, 0, 
                               "Starting up...\n", 0L)) 
      {
          freeTstData(er);
          return(NULL);
      }

     Also, see initTstData().

   NOTES
     Your pointer is NULLed by this function.

   BUGS
     None.

   NAME
      initTstData - initialize test data-reporting mechanism

   SYNOPSIS
      tstData = initTstData(my_name, testMgrName)

      struct errReport *initTstData(STRPTR, STRPTR);

   FUNCTION
      Allocates a struct errReport for you and properly
      initializes it.  This includes forming a unique name for
      your program, creating a MsgPort, and setting up reasonable
      defaults.

   INPUTS
      my_name - a template to use to create a unique program name.
                This should be the same as the name of your test
                program.  If you supply NULL for this value, you
                will be known as "Test_Prog".
    tstMgrName- Name of the test manager program you would like
                to talk to.  This is often NULL, in which case the
                default, "TestMgr", is used.

   RESULT
     tstData - a pointer to a struct errReport which you may use
               with calls to errRpt().  THIS STRUCTURE MUST BE
               FREED BY A MATCHING CALL TO freeTstData()!!!
               Returns NULL for failure, in which case you should
               exit, as your test will be useless without any
               results displayed...

   EXAMPLE
      struct errReport *test;
      BYTE rc;
      int i;

      if (test = initTstData("MyTest",NULL)) {
         for (i = 0; i < MAX_TESTS; i++) {
            /* ... perform test... */
           if (test_ok) {
               /* report progress */
               rc = errRpt(test, LVL_PROG, PROB_NONE, NULL,
                       "Test %ld went OK\n", (LONG) i);
               if (rc != RPT_OK)
                  CleanUpAndExit(test); /* must freeTstData(test) ! */
           }
           else {
               /* report error */
               rc = errRpt(test, LVL_ERR, PROB_IOERR, IoErr(),
                       "Test %ld failed: %s\n", (LONG)i, MY_ERR_MSG);
               if (rc != RPT_OK)
                  CleanUpAndExit(test);  /* must freeTstData(test) ! */
           }
         }  
         freeTstData(test);
      }

   NOTES
    - An invocation of TestManager MUST be running before this
      function is called.
    - This function MUST be called before any other TestManager.library
      functions.
    - freeTstData() MUST be called on exit.
    - This function will request an ID number from the TestManager,
      and form the unique name from that plus the name you supply.

   BUGS
     None.
