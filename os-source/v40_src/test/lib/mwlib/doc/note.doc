NOTES:
    5/22/88 - OML is an old version which does not reconize the newer hunk
                types, such as those required by ProportionalTools.c. So-
                any program that needs this and other such modules will
                have to link them seperately. Damn it to hell, I know.
                A Possible option is to use Join.

    8/18/90 - MWlib2.0 - old MWLib is now frozen, and will not be used
                anymore for 2.0 development.
