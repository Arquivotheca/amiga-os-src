PURPOSE
    Test dos.library/SetFileSize for a particular file.

DESCRIPTION
    This test will attempt to truncate or lengthen the file
    you specify, according to the arguments you provide.
    If the file is lengthened, the additional characters will
    be trash (usually binary characters taken from the ROM,
    but that depends on what the current implementation in
    dos.library does).
    
    Progress and results are printed to the default
    output.  CLI usage only, V37 or better dos.library required.

TEMPLATE
    FILE/A, SIZE/A/N, MODE/K, SEEKTO/K/N, SEEKMODE/K

INPUTS
    FILE/A      - File to re-size.  Will be created if it doesn't exist.
    SIZE/A/N    - New size for file.
    MODE/K      - Mode for offset.  Default is 'B'eginning.
    SEEKTO/K/N  - Position to Seek() to before resizing.  Default: don't seek.
    SEEKMODE/K  - Mode to use for Seek().  Default is 'B'eginning.

    Valid options for Mode/SeekMode are:
        B = OFFSET_BEGINNING (beginning of file)
        E = OFFSET_END       (end of file)
        C = OFFSET_CURRENT   (current file position)
        Anything else is a fatal error.

RETURNS
    10 - Error on Seek() or SetFileSize()
    20 - Command-line error, or error with Open() of file.
