    NAME
        FLockercise -- File record locking excerciser

    SYNOPSIS

    FUNCTION
        FLockercise allows you to test the handling of record-locking
        on files. You may specify the actions for Flockercise to
        take, or load them from a '.flock' setup file.
        If a child experience an error in the instruction that it is
        executing, the user will be notified by a requester generated
        by that child.

        Seven processes are created to execute prepared instructions
        provided. The seven children are controlled by a master
        process that sends the instructions one at a time to the
        repective children. The master process can be left running
        or can be single-steped. The status display of the children are
        updated by the children themselves, not the master process,
        so you will have a picture of where each child is, rather
        than where the master thinks they are.

        There are several commands that the child processes may be
        given. they are:

            Open                (O"name") File to open (MODE_READWRITE)
            old open            (o"name") File to open (MODE_OLDFILE)
            new open            (n"name") File to open (MODE_NEWFILE)

            Close               (C)     Close opened file

            Timeout             (Tnnn)  Sets the timeout factor
            random timeout      (t)     Sets to a random value

            oFfset              (Fnnn)  Where to seek/test
                                        (a negagtive offset disables
                                        Seek()ing)

            random offset       (f)     Set to a random offset

            Length              (Lnnn)  Length of area to lock
            length              (l)     Set to a random length

            Exclusive           (E)     Exclusive lock
            exclusive           (e)     Exclusive immediate
            Shared              (S)     Shared lock
            shared              (s)     Shared immediate

            UnLock              (U)     Unlock Records (only if lock was
                                        obtained)

            unlock              (u)     Unlock Records irregardless of lock

            Write               (W)     Write data
            Write Alert         (w)     Write data and alert if not locked

            Read                (R)     Read and verify data
            Read Alert          (r)     Read and verify data, alert on fail
                                        (Note that the Read Alert command
                                        halts looping ([...]) if fails.

            repeat              (<)     Back to beginning until halted
                                        by ~Loop

            loop begin          ([)     Mark beginning of loop
            loop back           (])     Loop around to '[' until
                                        halted by ~Loop

    USAGE
        Before modifying, FLockercise must be in a halted state. You can
        do this by clicking Halt, or Reset. Also, your setup will normally
        consist of a Open followed by an Offset, Length, and Timeout
        specification. Then your loop containing Writes, Reads,
        Record-locking and Unlocking will be afterwards, and at the end
        of the loop will be a Close for the operation.

        The ~Loop key is used to gracefully end the processing of all
        loops, so that files are properly closed.

        Sometimes reqesters will pop up, indicating that a particular
        operation failed. Also some operations will shut off
        looping.

        Remember, don't modify the strings while its running. A preferred
        approach is to:
            ~Loop, and wait for all strings to reach a
                'permanet' operation

            Reset
            (setup with your strings (or Load)
            Start

        Since FLockercise starts in a running mode, hit Reset before
        typing into strings.

        Loading and Saving setups to a file: The file must have the
        extension ".flock" to be picked up by the file requester.

    EXAMPLE
        Several examples have been supplied. These examples are in
        the files with the prefix of '.flock' and may be loaded
        by clicking the Load button.

    NOTE
        FLockercise may be used to test other aspects of the filesystem,
        and may even be used to test handlers or anything that will
        respond to the Open() call. All it requires is a bit of
        imagination.
