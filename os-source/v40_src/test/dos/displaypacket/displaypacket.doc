                      A tool for monitoring DOS Packets

Purpose:
    Watch events at the Dos packet level for a given device.
    Single step mode is fully supported; failing certain packets
    and monitoring certain packets are partially supported.


Usage:
    copy testmountlist, DisplayPacket, and testdevice to a directory.
    run displaypacket <device to be monitored:>
    cd test1:
    ...and off you go...

    NB: You must reboot to exit.  Sorry 'bout that.

Notes:
    This program is still under construction.  The user interface needs
    to be cleaned up from the original PowerTools stuff Jerry used;
    this is why newer packets don't appear in the lists of things to
    return errors on, for instance.  Bugs will be squashed and features
    added as time permits.

    Note that all known fs-related packets should now be monitored
    and described by the current release.  There's probably only
    partial support for console-related packets, though.
