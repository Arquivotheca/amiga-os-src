KBInt

NAME
    KBInt -- lowlevel.library/AddKBInt() and RemKBInt() Test Program

SYNOPSIS
    CLI:
        KBInt

    Workbench:
        KBInt

FUNCTION
    KBInt is a part of a series of test programs for lowlevel.library.
    The purpose of KBInt is to test the lowlevel.library/AddKBInt() and
    RemKBInt() functions by installing a keyboard interrupt handler
    and displaying all keystrokes.

    The Key text gadget displays the ANSI mapping of the keystroke
    in the default keymap (if available).

    The Code number gadget displays the raw key code of the keystroke.

    The eight qualifier checkbox gadgets display the status of each
    qualifier:
        LShift      -   <Left Shift>
        RShift      -   <Right Shift>
        Caps Lock   -   <Caps Lock>
        Control     -   <Control>
        LAlt        -   <Left Alt>
        RAlt        -   <Right Alt>
        LAmiga      -   <Left Amiga>
        RAmiga      -   <Right Amiga>

    To terminate KBInt, select the close gadget of the window.

INPUTS
    None

RESULT
    RETURN_OK (0)       -   Success
    RETURN_WARN (5)     -   Warning
    RETURN_FAIL (20)    -   Failure

EXAMPLE

NOTES
    To ensure that the specified user data for the keyboard interrupt
    handler is correctly received, the keyboard interrupt handler
    compares the interrupt data against a magic cookie. If any calls
    to interrupt routine had incorrect interrupt data, the user is
    notified when the program exits and a warning (RETURN_WARN (5))
    is returned by KBInt.

BUGS
    If keyboard interrupts occur faster than keyboard update
    routine can display changes, some keyboard events will not
    be displayed.
