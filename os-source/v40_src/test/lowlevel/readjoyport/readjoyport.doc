NAME
    ReadJoyPort -- lowlevel.library/ReadJoyPort() Test Program

SYNOPSIS
    CLI:
        ReadJoyPort PORT/N,STICKY/S

    Workbench Tooltypes:
        PORT=<port number>
        STICKY

FUNCTION
    ReadJoyPort is a part of a series of test programs for lowlevel.library.
    The purpose of ReadJoyPort is to continually display the status of the
    game controller port, using the lowlevel.library/ReadJoyPort() function.

    The default game controller port is port 0. To change the port, use
    the Port integer gadget.

    The Type text gadget displays the type of controller, as detected by the
    system.

    The Sticky checkbox gadget is used to select "sticky" mode. In sticky
    mode, button and direction status gadgets are not cleared when the
    button or directional control is released.

    The Reset button is used to clear all button and directional status
    gadgets. This is useful in sticky mode.

    The Mode button is used to select the joystick port mode (via the
    lowlevel.library/SetJoyPortAttrs() function). Modes are:

        Game Controller     (equivalent to SJA_TYPE_GAMECTLR)
        Joystick            (equivalent to SJA_TYPE_JOYSTK)
        Mouse               (equivalent to SJA_TYPE_MOUSE)
        Autosense           (equivalent to SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE)

    The Btn 1-7 checkbox gadgets display the status of the game controller
    buttons.

    The Up, Down, Left, and Right checkbox gadgets display up, down, left, and
    right movement for game and joystick controllers.

    The Vertical and Horizontal integer gadgets display the vertical and
    horizontal values for mouse controllers.

    If an error condition on a controller is detected, the
    intuition.library/DisplayBeep() function is called. This will
    flash the display and/or generate an audible beep, as configured in
    the Sound Preferences editor. The error conditions currently
    tested for are:

    o   Simultaneous mutually-exclusive directions (i.e., left
        and right, up and down) on game controllers or joysticks.

    To terminate ReadJoyPort, select the close gadget of the window.
