TimerInt

NAME
    TimerInt -- lowlevel.library/AddTimerInt(), RemTimerInt(),
        StartTimerInt(), StopTimerInt() Test Program

SYNOPSIS
    CLI:
        TimerInt

    Workbench:
        TimerInt

FUNCTION
    TimerInt is a part of a series of test programs for lowlevel.library.
    The purpose of TimerInt is to test the lowlevel.library/AddTimerInt(),
    RemTimerInt(), StartTimerInt(), and StopTimerInt() functions by
    installing a timer interrupt handler and starting and stopping
    one-shot and continuous timers.

    To set the timer interval, use the Interval integer gadget.

    To select the timer mode (one-shot or continuous), use the Mode
    cycle gadget.

    To start the timer interrupt, select the Start button gadget.
    Note that to run a one-shot timer multiple times, the Start button
    gadget must be selected for each run.

    To stop the timer interrupt, select the Stop button gadget.

    The Deviation number gadget displays the maximum deviation (in
    microseconds) between the timer interrupt and independent timings
    performed using the system clock.

    To terminate TimerInt, select the close gadget of the window.

INPUTS
    None

RESULT
    RETURN_OK (0)       -   Success
    RETURN_WARN (5)     -   Warning
    RETURN_FAIL (20)    -   Failure

EXAMPLE

NOTES
    To ensure that the specified user data for the keyboard interrupt
    handler is correctly received, the keyboard interrupt handler
    compares the interrupt data against a magic cookie. If any calls
    to interrupt routine had incorrect interrupt data, the user is
    notified when the program exits and a warning (RETURN_WARN (5))
    is returned by KBInt.

BUGS
    If timer interrupt deviates from timing with timer.device by one second
    or more, an incorrect deviation will be reported because the deviation
    is measured in microseconds only.
