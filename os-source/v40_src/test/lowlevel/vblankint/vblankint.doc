VBlankInt

NAME
    VBlankInt -- lowlevel.library/AddVBlankInt(), RemVBlankInt()
        Test Program

SYNOPSIS
    CLI:
        VBlankInt

    Workbench:
        Not supported

FUNCTION
    VBlankInt is a part of a series of test programs for lowlevel.library.
    The purpose of VBlankInt is to test the lowlevel.library/AddVBlankInt()
    and RemVBlankInt() functions.

    VBlankInt sets up a vertical blank interrupt handler, waits one
    second, and outputs the following information:

    o   Total calls to vertical blank interrupt handler
        (should be 50 on PAL systems and 60 on NTSC systems)

    o   Calls to vertical blank interrupt handler (if any) with bad
        interrupt data; such calls should not occur

    o   Calls to vertical blank interrupt handler (if any) with vertical
        beam position beyond threshold line (row 20 for NTSC systems,
        row 25 for PAL systems)

INPUTS
    None

RESULT
    RETURN_OK (0)       -   Success
    RETURN_WARN (5)     -   Warning (possible problem detected)
    RETURN_FAIL (20)    -   Failure

EXAMPLE

NOTES
    VBlankInt may produce incorrect results (particularly in the
    total count of calls to the vertical blank interrupt handler) if
    run with mode promotion (set in the IControl Preferences editor) on.
