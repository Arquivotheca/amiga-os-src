            A Tool for GameController & Lowlevel.library Testing

                                 19 May 1993

USAGE
    CLI usage:
        [run] gamecontrol [screen <PubScreenName>]
    Workbench usage:
        double-click on the icon

PURPOSE
    The purpose of this beastie is to test the mechanical contacts on the game
    controller to see if there are any spurious directions.  It's quite
    visual.  To test, simply run this from CLI or Workbench, and have a game
    controller plugged into Port 1.  Press the directional keypad in such
    a way as to go along a straight line in one direction.  If you don't,
    there's a problem with the controller.

    It also happens to be yet another test of lowlevel.library's
    SystemControl(SCON_AddCreateKeys) function, which is why it lives
    where it lives on the server.

NOTES
    The SCREEN option (available only from the CLI) allows you to open this
    program on any public screen.  You will want to change the Workbench font
    to Topaz-8 or use this option if the window cannot be opened (it'll tell
    you if that's the problem).  If you're using Topaz-8, the window will
    open to the size of 628-wide and 193-high; your screen must be at least
    this large. That's usually not a problem, as the default NTSC screen is
    640x200, and the default PAL screen is 640x512.

    Another binary, called GameControlWrap, may be available.
    It won't stop when you reach the border, but will wrap around the grid.
    If that sounds confusing, run the program and you'll see what I mean.
