AllScreens - Mark Dolecki

This program uses NextDisplayInfo to attempt to open one screen of every type.
This is done for every display id and every depth (1-8).  After opening the
screen, a borderless backdrop window is opened on that screen and a SetRast()
is done to set the rastport's color to 1 (not exciting but I will add
something else later).  This is just the beginning of a basic sanity testing
program.

Usage:
From cli:  allscreens
	-this will walk the display info database once for all depths 1-8
From cli:  allscreens n
	-this will walk the display info database only for depth n

Note:  Output is simultaneously sent via stdio and KPrintF...

This is by no means a completed program.  I it is still in progress.
Suggestions are appreciated.
