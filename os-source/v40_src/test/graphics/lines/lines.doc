This is a quick test program that opens a user-chosen screen, creates a
copper list that changes custom.color[0] for every line, and installs it into
the user's screen.  It then waits for the use to close the window to exit.
This program is very useful for finding mrgcop bugs.

Usage:
From cli, "lines"
Click close to exit.

Moving different types of screens in front of the one created by this
program will show display corruption if problems exist.
