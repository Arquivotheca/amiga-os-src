Wchunky 1.0 - Mark Dolecki (doleckim@cbmvax.cbm.commodore.com) x9234

This is a program that tests the WriteChunkyPixels() graphics function by
using the function in random sized windows with user-selectable properties
on a user-selected screen.  The program has both a user selection window
(default) and an option to run all tests (very time intensive).

To use:
From cli, 'wchunky'
   - brings up a user selection window where the user can choose the
     parameters for the tests he wants to run.
From cli, 'wchunky all'
   - runs all tests

Suggestions, problems, etc. are welcome.
