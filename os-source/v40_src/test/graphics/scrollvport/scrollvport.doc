These are two test programs that test the ScrollVPort() call on an
intuition screen of the user's choice.  The two programs differ
only slightly.  Scroll calls ScrollVPort() without making any
changes to the screen's viewport.  ScrollMove makes changes to
the screen's RxOffset and RyOffset before calling ScrollVPort().

To Use:
From CLI, "scroll" or "scrollmove"
Press Esc to exit.
