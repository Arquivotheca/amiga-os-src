This program is an automated screen flipper.  It allows you to open
a screen of any dimensions and then toggle it from front to back
continously via the escape key.  The window must be active for the
escape key to work (it can be fun to catch the window if you somehow
deactivate it while flipping screens... :-)).

Usage:
From CLI, 'scrtoback'
	Brings up a small window with a single gadget that allows you
to choose a custom screen to open.  Pressing the escape key while the
window is activated will continously bring the custom screen to the
front and back.  Clicking the window's close gadget terminates the
program.
