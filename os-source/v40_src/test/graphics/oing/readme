	This is a little display hack I cooked up in an afternoon.  It's a
sort of sprite-based version of "Boing!", called Oing.

	This is written for the MANX compiler/assembler.  Conversion to
Lettuce is non-trivial, but you're a smart guy; I'm sure you can figure it
out.

	To construct this little gem, you say:

1> cc oing.c
1> as anim.s
1> as rnd.s
1> ln oing.o anim.o rnd.o -lc -o oing

	Edit as your setup dictates.

	MetaComCo assembler conversion notes:  If you have this assembler,
about the only change you need to make to the assembly files is to change
all occurences of the word "public" to "XDEF".  Remember Lettuce users that
rnd() is passed and returns a short (16 bits).

	The more I write stuff like this, the more I notice that I don't use
comments as much as I should.  If the code confuses you, tell me and I'll
try to explain things to you.

	Remember, this is only a parlor trick.  Have fun.
