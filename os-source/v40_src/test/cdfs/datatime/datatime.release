DataTime 1.1 has been released to:

    SoftPulic:SystemsAssurance/TestPrograms/CDFS/DataTime

From the Docfile:

USAGE:

    CLI usage:

    DataTime [NORMAL/S] [DOUBLE/S] [S=SIZE/K/N] [I=ITERATIONS/K/N] [F=FILE/K]
             [CD/S OFF=OFFSET/K/N]

PURPOSE:

    The purpose of Datatime is to provide a program that will do an
    AmigaDOS Read() of a given size, multiple times and get the timing of
    each read. It will also provide the total elapsed time of the reads
    both with the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation and
    such and without said overhead. Version 0.6 and higher will provide
    the tester with the longest readtime, the shortest readtime, and the
    average readtime. Version 0.7 or higher will also support CD_READ for
    comparision purposes.

NOTES:

    There is a known problem. The TimeLib function that I use to get
    the elapsed time needs to have a 68020 or better. If one is not
    present it will fail.

    Also, CD_READ requires that both SIZE and OFFSET be on a WORD
    boundary, at present the program does not check this. If you use
    the CD switch you must be sure that you feed SIZE and OFFSET even
    numbers. This will be fixed in future versions. Unfortunately I
    do not know what side effects that you may get from passing a
    non-WORD aligned byte total to either SIZE or OFFSET.
