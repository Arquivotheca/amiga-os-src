11 May 1993

    o   Version 0.1

    o   Initial Coding

12 May 1993

    o   Version 0.2

    o   Bug fixes

    o   Added multiple reads of the file

13 May 1993

    o   Version 0.3

    o   More bug fixes

    o   Fixed problems with multiple reads trashing memory and
        crashing the program.

    o   There is a problem with getting bumprev to work. So as of
        right now there is not a version string in DataTime. This
        will be fixed as soon a jjszucs gets back and I can figure
        out what the problem is.

17 May 1993

    o   Version 0.4

    o   Restructing and CleanUp by John J. Szucs

    o   Fixing of Bumprev. Everything is working fine.

18 May 1993

    o   Version 0.5

    o   Changed output so that only the Elapsed time of each read is
        printed to standard out.

    o   Added Elapsed Time with Overhead and Elapsed Time without
        overhead.

    o   Added a printout of the Command line so that when the program
        is redirected to a file the user will have a record of the
        Command line.

18 May 1993

    o   Version 0.6

    o   Added Minimum Readtime

    o   Added Maximum Readtime

    o   Added Avg. Readtime

18 May 1993

    o   Version 0.7

    o   Added CD_READ support

19 May 1993

    o   Version 1.1

    o   Just bumped version number for Release

    o   Released to SoftPublic:

21 May 1993

    o   Version 1.2

    o   Rearranged memory allocation to minimize memory fragmentation.
        The program no longer allocates and deallocates the read buffer
        each iteration. It now just allocates it once and frees it on
        exit. This helps to cut down on overhead also.

    o   Added printing of io_Error on a Failed CD_READ. This is for
        debugging purposes.

    o   Changed format of command line output. (I added a space for readability).
