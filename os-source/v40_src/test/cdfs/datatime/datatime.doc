USAGE:

The usage of the program is as follows:

DataTime [NORMAL/S] [DOUBLE/S] [S=SIZE/K/N] [I=ITERATIONS/K/N] [F=FILE/K]
         [CD/S OFF=OFFSET/K/N]

PURPOSE:

The purpose of Datatime is to provide a program that will do an
AmigaDOS Read() of a given size, multiple times and get the timing of
each read. It will also provide the total elapsed time of the reads
both with the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation and
such and without said overhead. Version 0.6 and higher will provide
the tester with the longest readtime, the shortest readtime, and the
average readtime. Version 0.7 and higher will support CD_READ for
comparision purposes.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS:

NORMAL/S:

    This is the default for CD32, it will set the CD-ROM drive to 75
    frames per second. Note: This program does not query the drive
    for max frame rate the drive can support. I may add this in a
    future version. Right now it only supports Normal and Double
    speed which are speeds the CD32 currently supports. If cd.device
    can not be opened by the program then the program will default to
    SPEED = NOT SET in the command line. This allows the program to
    be used on systems without cd.device. It will then read whatever
    file you have asked it to read.

DOUBLE/S:

    This sets the CD-ROM drive to 150 frames per second.

S=SIZE/K/N:

    The default is 262144, which is 256K. The user can specify any
    buffersize in bytes. Realize that the CD32 in its current
    configuration only has a max of 2MB. If the program cannot
    allocate the size of buffer given, the program will exit with a
    error code of 20. The letter S can be used as an abbreviation.
    If the CD switch is set then size must be on a WORD boundary, so
    use an even number of bytes. See NOTES for problem.

I=ITERATIONS/K/N:

    The default is 1 iteration. This is the number of times the
    program will attempt to read file into the buffer.

F=FILE/K:

    This is the only parameter that is required. The file that you
    choose must be larger than the size provided. If size is not
    provided then the file must be larger than 262144 bytes. If the
    file is not larger you will recieve an error message telling you
    that the actual read was not the same size as the read request.

CD/S:

    This switch is required to use the OFFSET command. If CD is not
    present then OFFSET will not be used

OFF=OFFSET/K/N

    This is the number of bytes from the beginning of the disk that
    the read is to begin. This number can be gotten by using the
    provided filepos program by jjszucs. This must be on a WORD
    boundary, in other words an even number. See NOTES for problem.

The defaults again are

Speed = NORMAL (if on a CD32)
Speed = NOT SET (if on a machine without cd.device)
Size = 262144
Iterations = 1


NOTES:

There is one known problem. The TimeLib function that I use to get
the elapsed time needs to have a 68020 or better. If one is not
present it will fail.

Also, CD_READ requires that both SIZE and OFFSET be on a WORD
boundary, at present the program does not check this. If you use
the CD switch you must be sure that you feed SIZE and OFFSET even
numbers. This will be fixed in future versions. Unfortunately I
do not know what side effects that you may get from passing a
non-WORD alligned byte total to either SIZE or OFFSET.
