MemCpy documentation, 12 March 1992, J.W. Lockhart

Purpose:
    Copy one memory region to another, logging progress.
    Optionally write a pattern to start, verify, set
    buffer size, or set priority.
    Note that the log is maintained by the MemServer.
    Verify errors and other problems will appear in this logfile.

Uses:
    Good for RAM tests and DMAC tests.  Also good for loading up
    the expansion bus.

Requires:
    MemServer already running.
    AmigaDOS 2.0x, V37 or better.  Shell, not Workbench.

Usage:
    [Run] MemCpy <from> <to> [buf] [reps] [pat] [pri] [ver] [copy]

Template: FROM=FROMBOARD/A, TO=TOBOARD/A, BUF=BUFSIZE/K/N,
          REPS/K/N, PAT/K/N, PRI=PRIORITY/K/N, VER=VERIFY/S, COPY/S

        FROM=FROMBOARD/A:  Board on which source mempool is located.
        TO=TOBOARD/A:      Board on which destination memory is located.
        BUF=BUFSIZE/K/N:   Size of source and destination memory pools.
        REPS/K/N:          Number of repetitions of test.
        PAT/K/N:           Pattern to write to RAM.  A single number,
                           range 0 to 255, is valid.
        PRI/K/N:           Priority at which to run.
        VER=VERIFY/S:      Whether to verify that the write was accurate.
        COPY/S:            Use an existing pool of memory if possible.  If 
                           existing memory is used, a pattern will not 
                           be written.

Defaults:
    BUF     512 KB
    REPS    30
    PAT     none
    PRI     2
    VER     off
    COPY    off

Notes:
    Task priority is set to 2 by default.  The intention is that the
    MemServer run at 4, your shell run at 3, the clients run at 2,
    and Workbench way down at 1.

    As of 12 March, this has not been revised to use the enhanced
    error reporting and client control features of V2.x MemServer.

    Also, the intended usage is RUN MEMCPY.  The Copy switch is very
    useful for conserving memory use.  For instance,
        run memcpy 1 2 ver pat 65
        wait 10 sec
        run memcpy 1 2 copy ver
    allows the first memcpy to write its pattern ("A") to the RAM and
    then set the block of RAM as readable by other clients.  The second
    memcpy then may use this block as its source block.

    Note that the source and destination blocks of RAM are the same size.
    Thus, specifying BUF 10240 will use 10240 bytes of RAM on the first
    board, and 10240 bytes of RAM on the second.

    Expansion boards are numbered 1 to n, starting closest to the CPU and
    proceeding to the left.  Non-RAM boards are not counted; neither are
    empty slots.  Alternatively, you may specify any of the following:

                       Board    Meaning
                       -----    -----------
                         MB     MOTHERBOARD 
                         CPU    CPU_BOARD 
                         1      BUS_1 
                         2      BUS_2 
                         3      BUS_3 
                         4      BUS_4 
                         5      BUS_5 
                         6      BUS_6 
                         CHIP   CHIP RAM
                         FAST   FAST RAM
                         ANY    ANY RAM
                         ROM    ROM 

    Be aware that the behavior of these values is highly dependent on the
    current behavior of the MemServer.  As of this writing, Motherboard RAM
    is the first fast RAM found which is not located on the expansion bus.
    ROM should work.  CPU is equivalent to BUS_1 if a CPU board with
    expansion RAM is present.  See Memserver.doc for more details.
