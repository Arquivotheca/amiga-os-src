PortsAway

Purpose:
    Delay until a given port or ports have closed.

Usage:
    PortsAway <case-sensitive portName pattern>

Template:
    PORT_PATTERN/A         - pattern of port to check for.
                             Case-sensitive (as are port names).
    TIME=CHECK_INTERVAL/N  - number of seconds to delay between 
                             checks of system Port list.
                             Default:  30 seconds.

Example:
    PortsAway (WriteFM|ReadMF|MemCpy)_#?
    PortsAway #?REX#? 5
       waits until all ports containing REX have vanished.  Try this
       with ARexx running, then issue the RXC command.  Unless you have
       additional ports containing REX, PortsAway will exit.

Requires:
    AmigaDOS V37 or better and Shell (no Workbench)

Intended usage:  
    Pause between sections of A2091 testing.
    ie,
        run memserver tmp:logfile safe
        run memcpy 1 2 ver pat 65
        wait 10 sec
        run memcpy 1 2 copy
        run memcpy 1 2 copy
        portsaway MemCpy_#?
        run writemf ...

    Note that only one pattern may be given, but that pattern may be
    arbitrarily complicated.  The pattern is case-sensitive, and uses
    dos.library ParsePattern() and MatchPattern().
