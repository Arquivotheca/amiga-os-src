   ReadFM - Read File into Memory

   ReadFM reads the given file into a block of RAM,
   x number of times.  It's smart enough to deal with files larger
   than the RAM size, and will do the appropriate Seek()s for proper
   verification (if specified).

Template:  FILE/A, MS=MEMSIZE/K/N, MT=MEMTYPE/K, REPS/K/N, FS=FILESIZE/K/N,
           PRI=PRIORITY/K/N, VER=VERIFY/S, RM=DELETE/S
Where:
           FILE      - file to read
           MEMSIZE   - Memory size in bytes. (default 256K)
           MEMTYPE   - Memory type/location/board (default any)
           REPS      - times to repeat test. (default 30)
           FS        - new size for file; implies file creation
           PRI       - Priority at which to run.  Default: 2.
           VER       - Whether to verify info (requires 2*RAM)
                       Default: no.
           DELETE    - Delete file when finished?  Default = NO.

Requires MemServer, AmigaDOS V37 or better, and a Shell.

Example usage:
    run readfm ms 1024000 mt any reps 2 fs 10000000 ver

Changes:
    Now gives verbose information on verification, complete with
    offsets and mismatched values.  The source RAM buffer is filled
    with 0xFF to start with, and the verify RAM buffer (if present)
    is filled with 0xEE.  Supports the changes made to MemServer V2.x.

Valid board/memory types:

    Expansion boards are numbered 1 to n, starting closest to the CPU and
    proceeding to the left.  Non-RAM boards are not counted; neither are
    empty slots.  Alternatively, you may specify any of the following:

                       Board    Meaning
                       -----    -----------
                         MB     MOTHERBOARD 
                         CPU    CPU_BOARD 
                         1      BUS_1 
                         2      BUS_2 
                         3      BUS_3 
                         4      BUS_4 
                         5      BUS_5 
                         6      BUS_6 
                         CHIP   CHIP RAM
                         FAST   FAST RAM
                         ANY    ANY RAM
                         ROM    ROM 

    Be aware that the behavior of these values is highly dependent on the
    current behavior of the MemServer.  As of this writing, Motherboard RAM
    is treated as any Fast RAM not on the expansion bus.
    ROM should now work.  CPU is equivalent to BUS_1 if a CPU board with
    expansion RAM is present.  If you get errors referring to boards
    or locations, you can check the MemServer.doc file for an explanation.
    These numbers are rarely encountered, but may be turned to English
    in future revisions.

    You should get an error if you specify ROM; ReadFM requires writeable
    memory...
