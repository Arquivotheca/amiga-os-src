KillServer

Purpose:
    Terminate MemServer.

Usage:
    KillServer

Notes:
    This *will* shut down the server in all circumstances, even if there
    are clients currently trying to use it.  Clients must be bright enough
    to deal with this.  (MemCpy, ReadFM, and WriteMF are aware of this.)
    All memory allocated by the server *will* be freed.

Intended usage:  
    To be run only after clients have terminated normally.
    Note that MemCpy, ReadFM, and WriteMF all respond to Control-C, and
    can easily be terminated this way.  (Of course, KillServer stops
    everything...)

    Note that MemServer ignores all break signals; this program (or a reboot)
    must be used to get rid of it.
