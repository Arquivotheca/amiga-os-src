@HelloWorld is a simple program showing how to use CatComp to localize an
application. There is a small program called helloworld.c which simply tries
to print two strings to the display in a localized form. There is a catalog
descriptor file called helloworld.cd which contains two strings. Finally,
there is a French catalog translation file called helloworld.ct. To
compile the example, just execute "helloworld.c".
