       The System Check screen is a diagnostic display triggered by
       failures during the autoconfig process.

       NOTE: It is currently possible to 'break' into the System
       Check screen by holding down both mouse buttons during the
       boot cycle.  This will be taken out before the final
       release, or maybe it won't.

       The display consists of a red screen with the title "System
       Expansion Board Check", a list of expansion devices
       currently installed, and a continue button.

       The expansion device list has one line for each device
       found. each line contains the following fields.

       Status         The status of a device can be "OK", or "BAD"
                      if the device failed in some way. Usually the
                      bad device will be a memory board that has
                      gone bad.

       Manufacturer   This is the Commodore assigned Manufacturer
                      number for the expansion device.

       Product        This is the manufacturer defined product ID.

       Chain          If two or more devices exist on the same
                      board there will be lines drawn at the end of
                      the 'Product' field to indicate this.

       The list of expansion devices is sorted so that the top
       entry on the screen corresponds to the board closest to the
       CPU. This is the rightmost board as you face an A2000 and
       the device directly plugged into an A1000 in a possibly
       chained configuration. I don't know where it is on an A3000.
       Remember that chained expansion devices are all on the same
       physical board.

       NOTE: Some early A2091 cards were flawed and do not appear
       to be chained.

       To continue with the boot process with the device disabled
       click on the 'CONTINUE' button with the mouse.

       System Check is implemented as the syscheck ROM-module. It
       has a ROM-TAG priority such that it initializes after
       expansion.library, graphics.library, and most of the other
       ROM-modules, but before the expansion boards Diag code is
       executed and the boot process has begun.

       On startup syscheck checks the Flags field in ExpansionBase
       for the flag EBF_BADMEM. If set syscheck opens a View and
       generates the display based on the list of ConfigDev
       structures in ExpansionBase. The flags in each ConfigDev
       structure are checked against CDF_BADMEMORY to determine
       which device failed.
