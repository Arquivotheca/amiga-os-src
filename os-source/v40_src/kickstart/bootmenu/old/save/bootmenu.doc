       Boot Menu is a system ROM module that is used to override
       hard drive boot partition prioritys and enable the system to
       be booted from a partition with a lower priority than the
       default boot partition.

       In addition Boot Menu has the ability to disable individual
       partitions so they do not appear on the DOS device list
       after boot thus removing the partition temporarily. Boot
       Menu can also disable all the hard drive partitions forcing
       a hard drive system to put up the "Insert Workbench Disk"
       screen.

       Boot Menu is activated by holding down both mouse buttons at
       boot time.

       The Boot Menu display consists of a gray screen titled "Boot
       Partition Menu", a list of the available hard drive
       partitions, and two buttons.

       The partitions list has one line for each partition. The
       partitions are arranged with the top partition always being
       the default boot partition.  After the default boot
       partition are the other bootable partitions in descending
       priority order followed by non-bootable partitions.

       NOTE: Currently only the first ten partitions are visible.

       Each partition entry has the following fields:

       Status    Either "ENABLED" and will be mounted at boot time,
                 or "DISABLED" and will not be mounted. This is a
                 gadget and be clicked on with the left mouse
                 button to change the state.

       Device    The device name for the partition. This is also a
                 gadget. Click on a devices gadget to boot from the
                 named device. The Device field of some devices
                 will be recessed. A recessed device gadget means
                 the device is either not bootable or disabled.

       Type      The DOS type for the partition normally,

                 DOS0 Old Filing System.

                 DOS1 Fast Filing System, FFS.

















       Pri       The boot priority for the partition or "N/A" if
                 the partition is not bootable.

       There are two buttons at the bottom of the screen. They are:

       CANCEL                        The cancel button will boot
                                     the system as if the Boot Menu
                                     had never opened.  Even if you
                                     have changed some of the
                                     gadgets on the screen. This is
                                     the safe way out.

       DISABLE ALL PARTITIONS & BOOT This button will disable all
                                     of the hard drive partitions
                                     and force the system to boot
                                     from floppy.

       Boot Menu is implemented as a ROM module with a ROM-TAG
       priority that causes it to initialize after the hard drives
       have been initialized but before the system has booted.

       Disabling partitions is done by Remove()'ing their nodes
       from ExpansionBase->eb_MountList. When disabling all
       partitions a NewList() is performed on eb_MountList.

       Booting a lower priority node is accomplished by
       Remove()'ing the node and the AddHead()'ing it the the
       begining of the list. The nodes priority is not changed!
