; This is a statistics block maintained by various portions of the file system.
; Use the new packet type ACTION_STATS to get a copy of the current statistics.
; When an ACTION_STATS is recieved, the statistics are copied to a user array
; and the current statistics are zeroed.  This makes it easy to do running stat
; averages by examining the s_TIMER field to see how many seconds passed since
; the last stat call.
