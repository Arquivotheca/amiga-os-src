This release of FFS fixes the following bugs that were in the 1.3 release.


1.	File system used to fail if the boot block of a disk contained
	zero in the first longword.  Fixed.

2.	Whenever a file not in the root was altered, the datestamp of the
	root block would be altered.  This has been fixed, the last modified
	date is now altered instead.

3.	Due to a calculation error when writing out the bitmap the disk
	would always validate on restart if it was >308Meg.  This has
	been fixed.  New limit is REALLY 2.5 Gig.  Tested to 600Mb.
