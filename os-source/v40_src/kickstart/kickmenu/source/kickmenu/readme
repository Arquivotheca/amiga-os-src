                        Kickmenu and Super Kickstart


Initial system setup.
---------------------

1) Make a small bootable hard drive partition with the device name 'WB_1.3'.
   (Defaults: DeviceName = WB_1.3
              VolumeName = Workbench1.3
              Size       = About 5 meg)
   Format the partition.
   Copy ALL a 1.3 workbench disk onto this partition.

2) Make a small bootable hard drive partition with the device name 'WB_2.x'.
   (Defaults: DeviceName = WB_2.x
              VolumeName = Workbench2.0
              Size       = About 5 meg)
   Format the partition.
   Copy ALL a 1.4 workbench disk onto this partition.

3) Make a nonbootable partition for your applications.
   (Defaults: DeviceName = DH0
              VolumeName = Work
              Size       = Rest of HD)
   Format the partition.
   Copy your applications to this partition.

4) Set the Boot priority for all bootable partitions to 0.

5) If you want the system to come up in 1.3 by default set the WB_1.3
   partitions priority to 1 (Higher than any other bootable partitions).

6) If you want the system to come up in 2.0 by default set the WB_2.x
   partitions priority to 1 (Higher than any other bootable partitions).

7) Using the 'makefiles' program on the Install disk type the following:

      Makefiles df0: 1.3 WB_1.3:devs/kickstart
   and
      Makefiles df0: 2.0 WB_2.x:devs/kickstart

8) Install the new ROMS and power up the machine.


Things to beat on.
------------------

1) Remove all fast memory.

2) Remove the devs:kickstart files and try to boot off the hard drive.


Hidden Features.
----------------

1) There is a hidden gadget in the upper left corner of the kickmenu
   screen. This will bring the system up on the hardware ROMS instead
   of the soft loaded ROM.

2) A rick Sterling magic disk will have the same effect as #1.

3) If the highest priority partition in NOT named 'WB_1.3' or 'WB_2.x'
   the system will boot that partition with the hardware ROMS.

4) If there are no bootable HD partitions the system will put up the
   kickmenu screen at powerup with the Hard Drive buttons ghosted.

5) If Either of the Hard Drive paritions are not found the corresponding
   button will be ghosted.
