$FEAF9A -   Change "cmp.l $8000" to "cmp.l #$8000".  This fixes the trackdisk
	    RAWREAD command for systems with one 3.5 inch drive.  This bug
	    is virtually unpatchable in software.  One drive will be a
	    typical A3000 configuration.


$FC019A -   Change sanity check on chip memory from 512K to 2MB. V1.3
	    Kickstart had a hard limit of 512K of chip memory at startup.
	    Any more chip memory would cause Exec to consider the system
	    corrupt at bootup, and clear all recoverable memory, zero all
	    RAM, etc.


Must use new FFS.  Change mask to $FFFFFFFC
