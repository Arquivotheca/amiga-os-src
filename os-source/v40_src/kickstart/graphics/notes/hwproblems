Current known AA h/w problems:

      - BPRUN (internal signal). This prevents me from working on an optimal
        value for DDFSTOP, and I am delaying optimising DDFSTRT until the 
        same time.

      - BBUSY fix needs to be verified.

      - DIWSTRT/STOP H0 bits should no longer turn off the display.

      - (Should reset FMODE on powerup).

      - HAM heat problems (at least on my machine)

      - "Banding" on the display by sprite, and by fetch cycles. I think this is
        a board problem that Dave has fixed though.

      - DBLCAS has not been checked as a 2x mode.

      - VideoSlot problems.
