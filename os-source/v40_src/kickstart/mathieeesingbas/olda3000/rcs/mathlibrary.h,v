@Wow - this was never RCS'ed!  Worse, the .h, and .i files in V:include
are not the same as this (some fields are hidden) - Needs work, but we
are so close to closing up shop for this release, leave for module
owner to do another day.

* MathResources may need to know when a program opens or closes this
* library. The functions TaskOpenLib and TaskCloseLib are called when 
* a task opens or closes this library. They are initialized to point to
* local initialization pertaining to 68881 stuff if 68881 resources 
* are found. To override the default the vendor must provide appropriate 
* hooks in the MathIEEEResource. If specified, these will be called 
* when the library initializes.
