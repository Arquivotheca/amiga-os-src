The .doc files generated by the A500/2000, and A3000 mathieeesingbas
source trees differ :-(  Beaware - really the two source trees
shouldn't differ.


Also as of 5/9/91 two of the .h files were never RCS'ed ... they don't
fully match whats in V:include/libraries/

The MAKEFILE needs to be played with too - fix-up what is, and what
is not EXTERN, and INTERN files so that MAKE INTERNAL properly
updates V:include/libraries/

Note that mathlibrary.i is used to build the module; it should NOT
be made public because it contains definitions for private fields
in the library base.  mathlibrary.i in V:include/libraries has
these fields hidden.

Probably out to define the library base in a private file, and make
mathlibrary.h/i match what goes into V:include/library
