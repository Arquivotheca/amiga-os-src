(hitgadgets.c: 38.7)
GadgetHelp no longer considers the screen bar layer to be in the active
window.

(pointer.c: 39.23)
Fixed sprite hotspot error for old SetPointer().  Fixed pointer jumping
during screen drag (ChangeExtSprite() could receive a new vp but the
sprite had coordinates scaled to the old VP).

(screens.c: 38.47)
Fixed race-condition which could lead to LoadView(NULL).

(view.c: 38.26)
Minor comment/style cleanup around Mike's fix.
