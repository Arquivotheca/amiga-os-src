(Makefile: 38.8)
Make pdown rule now addresses my A3000, not the A2000.

(downcode.asm: 38.1)
Added _openWindowOnlyTags().  Moved _openScreenOnlyTags() here.

(ezreq.c: 38.4)
Optimized to open the window with tags only.  Also, handling of
default requester title made simpler.

(i.h: 38.4)
Added WinTitleLength to XWindow.

(images.c: 38.2)
ROM default pointer now matches 2.0 default pointer.

(screens.c: 38.15)
Now supports SA_Interleaved.  Minor autodoc fix.  CustomBitMaps through
NewScreen.Type of CUSTOMBITMAP were broken.

(screens.h: 38.8)
New SA_Interleaved tag.

(screens.i: 38.7)
New SA_Interleaved tag.

(view.c: 38.8)
Deleted unused #define.  Changed when reportMouse() is called, to
eliminate certain sprite-jumping during mode-switches.

(wbench.c: 38.6)
openScreenTagsOnly downcoded.  The way in which the WB screen was
ensured to be 640 x 200 doesn't work.  It must go into screens.c
instead.

(windows.c: 38.10)
Now uses/sets/clears XWindow->WinTitleLength.

(wtags.c: 38.8)
XWindow->WinTitleLength starts out invalid.

(xsysiclass.c: 38.7)
Now uses font's em-space instead of tf_XSize for Amiga-key and check widths.
Re-ordered ImageInfo structure for space.

(zoom.c: 38.3)
Window size changing now invalidates XWindow->WinTitleLength.
