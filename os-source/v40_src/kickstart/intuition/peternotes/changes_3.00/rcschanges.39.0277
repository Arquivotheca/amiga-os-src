(intuition.h: 38.5)
WA_BackFill no longer marked as unimplemented.

(intuition.i: 38.4)
WA_BackFill no longer marked as unimplemented.

(screens.c: 38.11)
Uses new LAYERS_NOBACKFILL magic constant instead of a stub hook for
SCREENQUIET bar-layers and menu clip-layers.  Installs a no-op
layer-info backfill hook instead of poking the RastPort mask so that
disposing the menu-layer doesn't clear the underlying bits.  Now
supports SA_BackFill.  Removed PEN_NO_SETCOLOR kludge, since graphics
now has this feature.

(screens.h: 38.6)
Defined SA_BackFill.

(screens.i: 38.5)
Defined SA_BackFill.

(init.c: 38.5)
Now requires layers and graphics V39.

(coercion.c: 38.7)
Now get CoerceMode() flags from <graphics/coerce.h> (private
definitions of AVOID_FLICKER and PRESERVE_COLORS, were reversed).
Removed some obsolete code.

(ibase.h: 38.4)
Defined IC_MODEPROMOTION.  Someday should switch to including
<Prefs/icontrol.h>.

(iprefs.c: 38.2)
Now calls RethinkDisplay() when IControl Prefs changes.

(view.c: 38.6)
Fixed bug where ViewPort offsets were only being set up when the
ViewPort was visible and MEGAFORCE was in effect.  Caused problems
with scaling DClips, where VP offsets need poking even if VP is
invisible.

(dclip.c: 38.1)
Fixed a comment about DClips.

(wbench.c: 38.4)
GetScreenData() was going through the database to check the screen's
property flags, but we cached those in NaturalDProperties.

(sc.h: 38.4)
Marked two unused fields as such.
