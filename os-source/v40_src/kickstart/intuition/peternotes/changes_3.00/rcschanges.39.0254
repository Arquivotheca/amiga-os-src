(coercion.c: 38.4)
No longer figures coercion, but relies on graphics/CoerceMode().

(coercion.c: 38.5)
Removed useless DClip scaling code.  Now attempts to do it correctly.

(coercion.c: 38.6)
coerceScreens() now distinguishes between FORCE (recalc coercion)
and NOFORCE (don't bother).

(frameiclass.c: 38.1)
Minor optimizations.  Penless frames now select into the right colors.

(ibase.h: 38.3)
IBitMap and SBitMap and other unused fields renamed to xxx(...).

(init.c: 38.4)
ItemCRect.BitMap and SubCRect.BitMap no longer initialized.

(menu.c: 38.6)
Menu bitmaps now come from AllocBitMap(), to save space and also to
be copacetic with graphics' interleaved bitmaps.

(misc.c: 38.6)
Deleted BLITBYTES() function; now in-line in menu.c.

(screens.c: 38.10)
Fixed bug where depth of CUSTOMBITMAP screens was mis-handled.
Now calls ObtainPen() instead of AllocPalette() [name change only].
IOpenScreen() now calls coerceScreens() with FORCE.

(scsupp.c: 38.5)
No longer refreshes IBitMap and SBitMap upon setScreen().

(sgadget.c: 38.3)
Now calls windowObscured() instead of LayerObscured().

(vectorclass.c: 38.6)
Now keep three ImageData pointers per image, not eight.  Saves 40 bytes
per image.

(vectorclass.h: 38.4)
New definitions allow collapsed states.

(vectorclass.i: 38.2)
Updated to match vectorclass.h changes.  New definitions allow
collapsed states.

(view.c: 38.5)
rethinkVPorts() and modeSnoop() now call coerceScreens() with FORCE.
modeVerify() now calls setupMonitor() with appropriate FORCE.

(windows.c: 38.8)
Added windowObscured() function.
