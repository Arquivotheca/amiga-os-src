(coercion.c: 38.8)
Added promoteScreen() function.  coerceScreens() now uses
PromotedDRecord to enquire about the front screen.  coerceScreenGrunt()
now takes PromotedDisplayID as the ID of the front screen.

Now uses IBase->ActiveMonitorSpec to tell when overscan preferences
should shift the View.  This is needed to handle promotion.

Added PromotedMSpec, PromotedDRecord, and PromotedDisplayID to XScreen
structure.

(screens.c: 38.12)
OpenScreenTagList() now calls promoteScreen().

(view.c: 38.7)
monitorCheck() now examines PromotedMSpec instead of NaturalMSpec, in order
to handle mode promotion.  RemakeDisplay() calls promoteScreen() for each
screen.

(xsysidata.asm: 38.1)
New arrow imagery.
