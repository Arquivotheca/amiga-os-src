Modified SetPointer() to do nothing if the window is in refresh.  Some
applications called SetPointer() inside of BeginRefresh() or
BeginUpdate(), which used to work.  Under V39, they had been
deadlocking.

Fixed definition of GTYP_GTYPEMASK in intuition.i.

For an AUTOKNOB proportional gadget, an application must supply a
struct Image for Intuition's use.  It used to be unnecessary to
initialize this Image structure, since Intuition initialized all the
fields it cared about.  The test for IA_SupportsDisable (added for
V39) checks to see if an image is a custom image before sending it an
OM_GET method.  This test is checking if the Image Depth is
CUSTOMIMAGEDEPTH, which is -1.  An uninitialized Image structure could
have had this value, causing a system crash.  We no longer send OM_GET
to AUTOKNOB images.

EasyRequests once again open in the on-screen portion of an oversized
screen.  This was how V37 worked, and it fell out of V39 by accident.

The menu code was checking FSF_TAGGED in ta_Flags instead of ta_Style.
Correcting this fixes support for tagged TextAttrs in Intuition menus.
