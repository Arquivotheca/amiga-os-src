***** Non-flashing checkmarks add 376 bytes.

***** Initially split off after 37.313.
***** Updated to match 37.318.  Only file that had to be merged is
***** screens.c.



***** doesn't handle flying win->Block/DetailPen changes.
***** the dropshadow stuff is poorly coded.
***** doesn't use xsysiclass first for default check and key.

***** I could reverse the monochrome bar pens for fun, but more work
      would be needed if we like it that way.
