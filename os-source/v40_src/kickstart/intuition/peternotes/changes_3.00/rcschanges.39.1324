use of VP_HIDE.

(windows.c: 38.23)
setWindow() asserts IBASELOCK and now gets 'initial' information from
the window itself.  itACTIVATEWIN loses it_SubCommand.  Synchronous
window activation now relies on a WMF_ flag, to fix vulnerability
against other window activators.  Removed extra call to draw window
edges.

itACTIVATEWIN loses it_SubCommand.  Synchronous window activation now
relies on a WMF_ flag, to fix vulnerability against other window
activators.
