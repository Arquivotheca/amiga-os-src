Now detect and handle the technique Disney Animator uses to achieve
their "onion" effect.

Now detect screen bitmap depth-pokers.  Detection of this and bitplane
pokers now happens at MakeScreen() time as well as at RethinkDisplay().

If the pointer image comes from SetPrefs(), its resolution will be
POINTERXRESN_LORES, instead of POINTERXRESN_DEFAULT.  This matches the
other source of old pointers (SetPointer()), and looks better on
320-wide VGA-type modes.

Now relies on the fact that the classic MoveSprite() off-by-one bug
(which we have to keep for compatibility) is fixed when dealing with
ExtSprites.  This is much simpler and preferable to figuring out what
"off-by-one" should be when dealing with variable sprite and bitmap
resolutions.  Along with a forthcoming graphics, this should fix all
sprite hot-spot errors with the exception of MaxOScan double-NTSC and
etc.  screens.

A timing hole in OpenScreen() and CloseScreen() could cause Intuition
to LoadView(NULL) even though there were screens that could be
displayed.  This can lead to unnecessary monitor resynching, or
enforcer hits in certain cases.

Intuition passes bad coordinates to MoveSprite() in certain cases
(eg. screen movement, depth-arrangement, opening/closing), which can
cause the pointer to jump momentarily.

Now avoid a possible infinite recursion between pointer changes and
RethinkDisplay().  This fixes a problem which kills DPaint 4.1 when
animation is stopped.

Gadget Help no longer reports the mouse is in the window when it is
actually over the screen drag bar.

If the graphics database tells Intuition that a mode is unavailable
for any reason other than no chips or no monitor, OpenScreen() will
now fail.  (This currently applies to modes that are unavailable with
genlock).  The error code will be OSERR_NOTAVAILABLE.

Took a small very safe optimization involving GetTagData() where the
default value is zero.
