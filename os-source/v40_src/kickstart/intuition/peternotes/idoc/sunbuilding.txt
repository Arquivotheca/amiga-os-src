Here are some notes on building Intuition using the Sun.  As you may know,
Intuition V40 is still Sun-built, and I use heartofgold.  My home directory
for Intuition is /exec/peter/intuition.

Intuition uses Sun MakeMeta, but the number of people familiar with
Sun MakeMeta is now just about zip.  You can find a commented version
of it in V:tools/MakeMeta.nostrip.  Change that file, and type Make to
regenerate the stripped V:Tools/MakeMeta.

To make Intuition, type "make".  Here are some other good verbs:

make internal:
	Standard rule to verify that all changes are checked in,
	and revlabel and release the code.

make iflow:
	Builds a calling tree for Intuition.  Pity we don't have these
	tools native.  You can subsequently type "iwho function" to
	see the callers of that function.

make tags:
	Standard rule to build ctags.  Everybody should use them.
	Somehow, I'm the only one left who does.  Tag files are
	easy to parse, and allow very convenient navigation of
	source code.

make clean:
	Erase all derivative files.

Intuition's makefile is set up to bump the revision just before it
links.  Most other people only bump the revision before making a release,
but this is the way that was originally intended when the standard
build environment was set up.

Intuition also has a debug-function linker-library which contains
support functions to print various Intuition structures you're likely
to encounter.
