(coercion.c: 38.21)
DBLNTSC monitor now defaults to the correct MouseScaleY.

(dclip.c: 38.14)
When the base autoscroll amount was changed to be the amount the mouse
position exceeded the MouseLimits (instead of the amount the mouse
position exceeded DClip), the test to scroll no farther than the
excess amount of screen outside the DClip was incorrectly changed to
use MouseLimits too.  That test once again uses the DClip.
Child screens fully off the bottom no longer autoscroll up.  If they
did, we could trap a child/parent in an undraggable condition.

(ihfront.c: 38.10)
Keyboard control of mouse cursor now uses exact value even if no
window is active.

(mouse.c: 38.5)
An off-the-bottom child screen can no longer play havoc with the
MouseLimits.

(scsupp.c: 38.29)
IsHires() and canSlide() moved here from view.c.  SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE
now uses the coerced DisplayClip, which produces better results.

(view.c: 38.31)
IsHires() and canSlide() moved to scsupp.c.
