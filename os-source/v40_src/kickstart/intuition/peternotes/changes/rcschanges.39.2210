(dclip.c: 38.13)
Child screens that are legitimately off the bottom of the DClip are no
longer brought back "in bounds" by RethinkDisplay().
screenLegalPosition() now interprets SPOS_FORCEDRAG instead of relying
on PSF_DRAGOVERRIDE being set.

(intuinternal.h: 38.28)
Defined SPOS_BOUNDEDBOTTOM.  Removed SPOS_FUNCTIONCALL.

(ism.c: 38.4)
Now update IBase->Seconds/Micros for every event that has a reasonable
timestamp.

(sc.h: 38.25)
Removed PSF_DRAGOVERRIDE.

(scsupp.c: 38.27)
IMoveScreen() now handles SPOS_FORCEDRAG by passing this flag to
canSlide() and screenLegalPosition(), as appropriate.  This replaces
a cruddy method that set a flag temporarily in the screen structure.

(sscreendrag.c: 38.12)
When setting up screen-drag mouse-limits, now requests the screen
limits to be always bounded on the bottom.  (Needed due to the fact
that child screens are now unbounded on the bottom by default).

(timing.c: 38.4)
Added comment about IBase->Seconds/Micros.

(view.c: 38.29)
canSlide() now takes an override parameter instead of trying to
second-guess things.
