(coercion.c: 38.22)
Now support families of exclusive screens.

(dclip.c: 38.15)
Finally handles horizontal relationship between non-draggable child
and its parent.  screenLegalPosition() for non-draggable screens
now returns the nearest legal position to the current position.
(Non-draggable child screens weren't having their TopEdge validated as
>= parent's).  Now support families of exclusive screens.

(downcode.asm: 38.11)
Added nonDegenerate().  Renamed gzzBox() to windowInnerBox().

(intuinternal.h: 38.29)
Minor comment cleanup around DRAWGADGETS_xxx flags.

(intuitionface.asm: 38.22)
Minor comment cleanup around RefreshWindowFrame() stub.

(iprefs.c: 38.20)
SetIPrefs() now bounds-checks Overscan values

(ism.c: 38.5)
Fixed window of vulnerability in doISM() if calling task has priority
greater than input.device.

(isupport.c: 38.15)
Renamed borderPatrol() to internalBorderPatrol().

and its parent.  Now support families of exclusive screens.

(size.c: 38.7)
Cleaned up borderDamage() code to flash a lot less, by only erasing
the border where we really need to.  Likewise for gadgetDamage().

(smenu.c: 38.19)
Was forgetting to clear WMF_NEEDMENUCLEAR, which meant extraneous
MENUUP messages could be sent.  In a few cases, wasn't ensuring that
every MENUVERIFY was followed by a MENUPICK.

(windows.c: 38.34)
Cleaned up and simplified getright().  Fixed bug in IOpenWindow()
which could leave unrepaired damage if layer creation failed.
drawEmbossedBorder() now uses DRAWGADGETS_xxx flags, and skips the
first rendering of the window frame edges if this is just an
activation-change.

(wtags.c: 38.27)
drawEmbossedBorder() now takes DRAWGADGETS_xxx flags.
