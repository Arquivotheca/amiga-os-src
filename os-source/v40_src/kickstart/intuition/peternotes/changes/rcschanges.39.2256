(coercion.c: 38.20)
Now request syncing up of ViewPort positions when coercion moves a
screen.

(frameiclass.c: 38.5)
IM_FRAMEBOX now correct for frame-types other than FRAME_DEFAULT.
The frame geometry is now more data-driven.  Minor optimizations.

(imageclass.c: 38.6)
Deleted some dead code.  ImageClass now uses UnpackStructureTags().

(sc.h: 38.26)
Added PSF_NEWSCREENOFFSETS.

(screens.c: 38.49)
SCREENQUIET BarLayers now have their backfill hook reset after
opening, for V37-compatible behavior.  Now rely on screenGadgets()
testing the SCREENQUIET flag.

(scsupp.c: 38.28)
screenGadgets() now figures out for itself that it's a SCREENQUIET screen.

(view.c: 38.30)
Eliminated unneeded test for MakeVPort().  Elaborated comments about
off-the-bottom ViewPorts.  Now handle coercion's requests to sync
up VP coordinates.
