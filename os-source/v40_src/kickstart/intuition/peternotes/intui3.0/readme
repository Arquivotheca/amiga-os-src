LockScreen.notes:
- Notes on creating a function which is basically an
  Intuition-friendly LockLayerInfo/LockLayers, useful before
  trans-window rendering such as icon-dragging.

MouseOverrun.notes:
- Sample code to go in ih.c which attempts to handle the mouse-counter
  overrun.  The basic idea is that if on the previous time through,
  the mouse counter showed "very fast" (i.e.  a large positive
  number), you interpret "very slow" (i.e.  a large negative number)
  as being a wrap.

ScreenReset.notes:
- Idea on a function to allow screen to close even though visitors are
  on it (like what happens with WB, but generalized for any screen).
