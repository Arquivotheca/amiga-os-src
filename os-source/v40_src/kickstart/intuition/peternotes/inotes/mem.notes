Ideas on reducing Intuition RAM usage:

vectorclass.c: Don't need to keep the vcd_RP and vcd_TmpRas around.
This represents 100 bytes for the RP. (8 for TmpRas).

IntuitionBase has an array of SignalSemaphores.  This includes three
dummy sems (LAYERINFOLOCK and LAYERROMLOCK) which together take
138 bytes of RAM, even though they're only used when debugging is
turned on.
