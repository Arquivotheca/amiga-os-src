*
* Shared bits in the battery-backedup ram.
*
*	Bits 64 and above
*

*
* SHARED_AMNESIA
*
*		The battery-backedup memory has had a memory loss.
*		This bit is used as a flag that the user should be
*		notified that all battery-backed bit have been
*		reset and that some attention is required. Zero
*		indicates that a memory loss has occured.
*

BATTMEM_SHARED_AMNESIA_ADDR	EQU	64
BATTMEM_SHARED_AMNESIA_LEN	EQU	1


*
* SCSI_HOST_ID
*
*		a 3 bit field (0-7) that is stored in complemented form
*		(this is so that default value of 0 really means 7)
*		It's used to set the A3000 controllers SCSI ID (on reset)
*

BATTMEM_SCSI_HOST_ID_ADDR	EQU	65
BATTMEM_SCSI_HOST_ID_LEN	EQU	3


*
* SCSI_SYNC_XFER
*
*		determines if the driver should initiate synchronous
*		transfer requests or leave it to the drive to send the
*		first request.  This supports drives that crash or
*		otherwise get confused when presented with a sync xfer
*		message.  Default=0=sync xfer not initiated.
*

BATTMEM_SCSI_SYNC_XFER_ADDR	EQU	68
BATTMEM_SCSI_SYNC_XFER_LEN	EQU	1

*
* SCSI_FAST_SYNC
*
*		determines if the driver should initiate fast synchronous
*		transfer requests (>5MB/s) instead of older <=5MB/s requests.
*		Note that this has no effect if synchronous transfers are not
*		negotiated by either side.
*		Default=0=fast sync xfer used.  
*

BATTMEM_SCSI_FAST_SYNC_ADDR	EQU	69
BATTMEM_SCSI_FAST_SYNC_LEN	EQU	1

*
* SCSI_TAG_QUEUES
*
*		determines if the driver should use SCSI-2 tagged queuing
*		which allows the drive to accept and reorder multiple read
*		and write requests.
*		Default=0=tagged queuing NOT enabled
*

BATTMEM_SCSI_TAG_QUEUES_ADDR	EQU	70
BATTMEM_SCSI_TAG_QUEUES_LEN	EQU	1

*
* IDE_EXTRA_WAIT
*
*		Makes the system wait an additional number of seconds on
*		every boot before accessing the IDE drives.  Currently
*		in V40 the number is 8 seconds.  Equivalent to the SCSI
*		TIMEOUT bit.
*		Default=0=no extra wait
*

BATTMEM_IDE_EXTRA_WAIT_ADDR	EQU	71
BATTMEM_IDE_EXTRA_WAIT_LEN	EQU	1

*
* MONITOR_MODE
*
*		A switch to show which monitor mode to boot into.
*		Currently only defines NTSC or PAL. This will override
*		the motherboard jumper settings, which are only used if
*		there is no battmem in the system. (V39)
*
