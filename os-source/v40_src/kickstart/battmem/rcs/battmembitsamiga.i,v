*
* Amiga specific bits in the battery-backedup ram.
*
*	Bits 0 to 31, inclusive
*

*
* AMIGA_AMNESIA
*
*		The battery-backedup memory has had a memory loss.
*		This bit is used as a flag that the user should be
*		notified that all battery-backed bit have been
*		reset and that some attention is required. Zero
*		indicates that a memory loss has occured.
*

BATTMEM_AMIGA_AMNESIA_ADDR	EQU	0
BATTMEM_AMIGA_AMNESIA_LEN	EQU	1


*
* SCSI_TIMEOUT
*
*		adjusts the timeout value for SCSI device selection.  A
*		value of 0 will produce short timeouts (128 ms) while a
*		value of 1 produces long timeouts (2 sec).  This is used
*		for SeaCrate drives (and some Maxtors apparently) that
*		don`t respond to selection until they are fully spun up
*		and intialised.
*

BATTMEM_SCSI_TIMEOUT_ADDR	EQU	1
BATTMEM_SCSI_TIMEOUT_LEN	EQU	1


*
* SCSI_LUNS
*
*		Determines if the controller attempts to access logical
*		units above 0 at any given SCSI address.  This prevents
*		problems with drives that respond to ALL LUN addresses
*		(instead of only 0 like they should).  Default value is
*		0 meaning don't support LUNs.

*
* MONITOR_MODE
*
*		A switch to show which monitor mode to boot into.
*		Currently only defines NTSC or PAL. This will override
*		the motherboard jumper settings, which are only used if
*		there is no battmem in the system. (V39)

* CHIP_REV
*
*		The V39 graphics function SetChipRev() will enable graphics
*		in the minimum chip rev of that passed to it, the revision set
*		in battmem, and the chips available. (V39)
