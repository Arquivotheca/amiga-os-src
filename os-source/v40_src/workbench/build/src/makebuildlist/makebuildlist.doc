                          ===========================

MakeBuildList is a tool to automate the creation of build lists suitable for
the MakeWB program. It scans any number of disks and directories, and creates
a build list describing all the files scanned. This lets you create a
complete Workbench disk set, protection bits, comments and all, and
automatically generate a build list describing the disks.


Operation
---------

The command-line template for MakeBuildList is:

    FROM/M/A,TO/A

    FROM
    Specifies the name of the disks to scan. This will usually be something
    like "Workbench3.0:", "Extras3.0:", etc... Any number of disks can be
    specified

    TO
    Specifies the name and path of the build list that should be created

The build list that is created still requires user editing before being
used with MakeWB, but the bulk of the work will have been done automatically.
Only pertinent fields are generated for each file descriptor in the build list,
keeping the build list smaller and more manageable. Fields that generally
need user editing are SOURCE and INSTALLATION.
