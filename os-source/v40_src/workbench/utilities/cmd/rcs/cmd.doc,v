				  CMD

USAGE:
    CMD [-s] [-m] [-n] <devicename> <filename>

PURPOSE:
    To redirects exec serial or parallel device CMD_WRITEs to a file.

SPECIFICATION:
    CMD allows the user to redirect either serial or parallel device
    CMD_WRITEs to a file.  This will enable him to, for example,
    capture printer output to a file.

    <devicename> should be either "serial" or "parallel" to redirect
    either serial or parallel, respectively.  <filename> is the name
    of the file to which the redirected output should be sent.  CMD
    options are as follows:

	-s	 Skip any short initial write (usually a reset if
		 redirecting a screendump)

	-m	 install for MULTIPLE files until Break or CTRL_C

	-n	 enable NOTIFY (helpful progress messages)

    The CMD command can also be used from WorkBench.  CMD recognizes the
    following paremeters in the Tool Types field of the CMD icon:

	DEVICE	 set to either parallel or serial

	FILE	 the name of the output file

	SKIP	 set to TRUE (skip any short initial write) or
		 FALSE (do not skip)

	MULTIPLE set to TRUE (install for MULTIPLE files) or
		 FALSE (do not install)

	NOTIFY	 set to TRUE (enable NOTIFY) or FALSE (do not
		 enable NOTIFY)

    Double-clicking the CMD icon from WorkBench implements redirecting
    as specified in Tool Types.  The default settings are:

			DEVICE=parallel
			FILE=ram:CMD_file
			SKIP=FALSE
			MULTIPLE=FALSE
			NOTIFY=FALSE

    NOTE:
    On a screen dump, the first CMD_WRITE is usually a printer RESET.
    The printer device then delays long enough for the reset to
    complete to prevent the loss of subsequent output data.  When the
    dump is instead captured in a file, this delay is of course lost.
    If your printer driver outputs a reset at the start of a dump, use
    the -s (SKIP) option to keep the initial CMD_WRITE out of the file.
