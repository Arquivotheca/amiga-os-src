 *	filestat.c    routines to manipulate file "stat" information
 *
 *  SCCS
 *
 *	@@(#)filestat.c	12.8	11 Feb 1991
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Contains routines to map between the internal and external
 *	representations of file "stat" information, such as protection
 *	modes and file type bits.  The internal representation is
 *	a superset of the classical UNIX definition of the st_mode
 *	field of the file's stat structure, and is also the format
 *	of the bits stored in the archive.  This mapping is not
 *	guaranteed to remain identical if UNIX changes in the future
 *	and particularly, when a port is done to non-UNIX machines,
 *	like the Amiga.

/*
 *	For compatibility between 4.2BSD and System V machines,
 *	we define certain file types that one has but the other
 *	doesn't.  This is so that a 4.2 system can handle a tape
 *	written under System V, and/or vice versa.  Luckily, there
 *	are only two cases, and the numbers don't conflict.  This
 *	does sort of defeat the whole purpose of standard header files
 *	to define magic constants, but what are we supposed to do?
 *
 *	This also works on the Pyramid, which defines both, and also
 *	happens to use the right magic numbers.
 *
 *	In addition, Masscomp has a special type of regular file,
 *	for which disk blocks are allocated contiguously.  This
 *	is yet another magic constant.
 *
 *	For now, these are not used here anyway, since there are
 *	equivalent constants defined in the finfo file for bru's
 *	private stat mechanism.
