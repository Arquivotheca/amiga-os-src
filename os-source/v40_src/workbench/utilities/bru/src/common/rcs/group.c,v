 *
 *	@@(#)group.c	12.8	11 Feb 1991
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Contains routines for translating from numerical gid's
 *	to symbolic group names found in /etc/group and vice-versa.
 *
 *	This involves very little overhead and is well worth
 *	the trouble to avoid the use of numerical id's whenever
 *	possible.
 *
 *	Supported routines are:
 *
 *		gp_init		initialize translation list
 *		gp_gname	translate gid to name
 *
 *
 *	This file is a duplication of passwd.c 5.2, modified to use
 *	the getgrent suite of routines.  So even though it was done at
 *	Georgia Tech, it is appropriate to include the copyright notice.

 *  FUNCTION
 *

 *
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	VOID gp_init ();
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Reads the system group file and initializes the translation
 *	list.
 *
 *	The tradeoff involved here is time vs space (as usual).
 *	The space consideration is the memory required to hold
 *	the translation list, which allows very fast access to
 *	any given user structure.  The time consideration is
 *	the amount of time required to use the library routines
 *	"getgrgid" and "getgrnam" to do translation on the fly
 *	without a translation list.  Since a large number of
 *	translations is the normal situation, and since memory
 *	demands are minimal, I have opted to read the password
 *	file once and maintain a translation list.
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *	Any failure to allocate sufficient memory is immediately
 *	fatal.
