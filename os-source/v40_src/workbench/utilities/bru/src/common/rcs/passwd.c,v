 *  FILE
 *
 *	passwd.c    password file interface routines
 *
 *  SCCS
 *
 *	@@(#)passwd.c	12.8	11 Feb 1991
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Contains routines for translating from numerical uid's
 *	and gid's to symbolic user names found in /etc/passwd
 *	and vice-versa.
 *
 *	This involves very little overhead and is well worth
 *	the trouble to avoid the use of numerical id's whenever
 *	possible.
 *
 *	Supported routines are:
 *
 *		ur_init		initialize translation list
 *		ur_guid		translate name to uid
 *		ur_gname	translate uid to name
 *

#include "globals.h"

/*
 *	A translation list of users is kept in a linear linked list
 *	with each link one of the "user" structures.  Search time
 *	to locate any link in the list is considered to be
 *	insignificant with respect to the total run time.
 *
 *	Initially, each new link was added at the head of the list,
 *	since this is the most efficient way to do things.  However,
 *	this results in the list being in reverse order when compared
 *	with entries in the password file.  In cases where there are two
 *	users with the same uid, this resulted in the "ls" command
 *	finding the first and "bru" finding the last.  In order
 *	to make bru's table output exactly equal to that from "ls",
 *	the pointer to the last list element is now used to add new
 *	elements at the end of the list.

 *  FUNCTION
 *
 *	ur_init    read password file and initialize translation list
 *
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	VOID ur_init ();
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Reads the system password file and initializes the translation
 *	list.
 *
 *	The tradeoff involved here is time vs space (as usual).
 *	The space consideration is the memory required to hold
 *	the translation list, which allows very fast access to
 *	any given user structure.  The time consideration is
 *	the amount of time required to use the library routines
 *	"getpwuid" and "getpwnam" to do translation on the fly
 *	without a translation list.  Since a large number of
 *	translations is the normal situation, and since memory
 *	demands are minimal, I have opted to read the password
 *	file once and maintain a translation list.
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *	Any failure to allocate sufficient memory is immediately
 *	fatal.
