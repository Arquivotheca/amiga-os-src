/*
 *  FILE
 *
 *	filter.c    functions for supporting filter mode
 *
 *  SCCS
 *
 *	@@(#)filter.c	12.8	11 Feb 1991
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	When filter mode is enabled, bru acts more like a normal
 *	Unix style filter program.  Rather than first collecting
 *	all the pathnames and building a possibly huge internal
 *	directory tree, bru acts on each pathname before proceeding
 *	on to the next.
 *
 *	Filter mode has several advantages.  First of all, it avoids
 *	building the internal file tree, thus saving lots of memory
 *	and possibly even allowing it to run when it otherwise would
 *	run out of available memory.  In addition, if the pathnames 
 *	are being supplied by a program like "find", it can take a
 *	LONG time to acquire all the pathnames if a tree is built
 *	first.  Avoiding this allows bru to start processing as
 *	soon as the first pathname is available.  An additional
 *	advantage to filter mode is that it makes it easier to use
 *	bru under the control of another program, like a window
 *	system interface.
 *
 *	Filter mode also has several disadvantages.  First of all,
 *	the pathnames must be supplied in exactly the order desired.
 *	This is not critical during archive creation; but during any
 *	mode where an archive is being read, the order must match
 *	the order in the existing archive for correct results.
 *	Another disadvantage is that filter mode effectively turns
 *	off automatic archiving of parent directories and automatic
 *	expansion of directories, but for most uses, this is the
 *	desired behavior anyway.

 *
 *	Get the next pathname from the input list.  This list may

 *	the Amiga version.
 *
 *	Enforce the limit of bufsize characters (including a
 *	null byte termination).  Ignore lines that consist of nothing
 *	but a newline character.  In order to get a valid name, the
 *	name must fit in the buffer and must be terminated in the
 *	input stream with either a newline character or EOF.  I.E.
 *	the last line is allowed to not be newline terminated and 
 *	things should still work, provided getchar continues to return
 *	EOF once it hits the end of the input stream.
