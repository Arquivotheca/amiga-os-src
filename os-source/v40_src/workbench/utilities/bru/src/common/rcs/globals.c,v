 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Large programs frequently become maintenance nightmares because
 *	of proliferation of global variables.  Whenever possible and
 *	practical, the philosophy of "information hiding" is adhered
 *	to in the individual modules making up this program.
 *
 *	However, there are cases where passing everything as parameters
 *	is either impractical, or at best, awkward.  In deference to this
 *	fact of life, all quantities globally available are collected
 *	into a single file so that such beasts can be
 *	easily identified and dealt with in modifications or
 *	when carving out pieces to build another program.
 *
 *	To avoid obscure system dependencies, every global
 *	should be initialized to some meaningful value.
 *
