 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	#include "trees.h"
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Contains defines for external routines to communicate with
 *	routines in the tree handling module.
 *
 *	The routine path_type can return the following types:
 *
 *		STEM	  =>	path is a stem of the tree
 *				(end of name before reaching leaf)
 *
 *		LEAF	  =>	path is a leaf
 *				(exact match, end of name at leaf)
 *
 *		EXTENSION =>	path is an extension of the tree
 *				(exact match to leaf before end of name)
 *
 *		NOMATCH	  =>	path does not match, but more matches
 *				may be possible
 *
 *		FINISHED  =>	no more paths will match
 *
 */
