.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.I Bru\^
is a
.B UNIX\^
filesystem backup utility with significant enhancements
over other more common utilities such as
.IR tar ,
.IR cpio ,
.IR volcopy ,
and
.IR dd .
Some of 
.IR bru 's
capabilities include:

.TP 3
\*(BU
Intelligent handling of large, sparse files.
.RE
.PD 1
.PP
When 
.I files\^
are specified on the command line then the actions to be
performed are limited to those
.IR files .
If a named file is a directory then it and all its descendants
are used.
If no
.I files\^
are specified then the default for writing archives is all files
in and below the current directory.
The default for reading archives is selection of all files in
the archive.
.PP
If \*(lq\-\*(rq is given instead of
.I files\^
then the standard input is read to obtain the file list.
This is useful in conjunction with the 
.I find\^
command to provide finer control over files selected for
backup.
Obviously this mode is only valid when 
.I bru\^
is not also reading its archive from the standard input.
.SH DEFAULTS
.ad
Various default parameters, such as archive device name
and size, archive buffer size, controlling terminal name,
etc. are system dependent.
These defaults, along with version, variant, and other
miscellaneous internal  information may be discovered
via the
.B \-h
mode.
.SH MODES
.ad
One or more of the following modes must be specified.
The order of execution, from highest priority to lowest, is 
.BR ecitxdgh .
.TP 10
.B \-c
.B Create\^
a new archive.
Forces a new archive to be created regardless of whether one
currently exists.
Writing starts at the first block.
.TP
.B \-d
.B Differences
between archived
.I files\^
and current
.I files\^
are detected and reported.
May be specified more than once, as
.B \-dd\^
.B \-ddd\^
or
.B \-dddd\^
to control level of difference checking.
.br
.sp
When specified as
.B \-d\^
.I bru\^
reports when it discovers that a regular file's size (st_size) or contents
(when compared as byte streams) has changed since the archive
was made.
.br
.sp
When specified as
.B \-dd\^
.I bru\^
reports additional differences in
modification date (st_mtime)
access mode (st_mode),
number of links (st_nlink) for non-directory files,
differences in the contents of symbolic links,
owner id (st_uid),
and
group id (st_gid).
.br
.sp
When specified as
.B \-ddd\^
.I bru\^
reports additional differences in
host device (st_dev),
major/minor device (st_rdev) for special files,
and
time of last access (st_atime) for regular files.
.br
.sp
When specified as 
.B \-dddd\^
.I bru\^
reports all differences except
time of last status change (st_ctime is not resettable),
major/minor device numbers for non-special files (meaningless),
and
size differences for directory files (may have empty entries).
The
.B \-dddd\^
mode is generally only meaningful during a verification
pass with full backups of
quiescent filesystems.
.TP
.B \-e
.B Estimate\^
media requirements for archive creation with same arguments.
Prints estimated number of volumes, number of files to be
archived, total number of archive blocks, and total size
of archive in kilobytes.
If the media size is unknown or unspecified,
it is assumed to be infinite.
.TP
.B \-g
Dump archive info block in a form more easily parsed by programs
implementing a complete filesystem management package.
Performs no other archive actions.
.TP
.B \-h
Print 
.B help\^
summary of options.
Also prints some internal information such as version number
and default values for archive pathname, media size,
archive buffer size, etc.
.TP
.B \-i
.B Inspect\^
archive for internal consistency and data integrity.
When
.B \-vv\^
option is also given, prints information from archive
header block.
.TP
.B \-t
List
.B table\^
of contents of archive.
When used with the
.B \-v\^
option will give a verbose table of contents in the same format as
the \*(lqls \-l\*(rq command.
When used with the
.B \-vv\^
option will also indicate what files are linked to other files,
and where symbolic links point to.
.TP
.B \-x
.B Extract\^
named
.I files\^
from archive.
If an archived file is extracted (see 
.B \-u\^
option) then the
access mode,
device id (special files only),
owner uid,
group uid,
access time,
and
modification time
are also restored.
If the
.B \-C
flag is given (see below),
then the owner uid and group uid will be changed to that of the current user.
.br
.sp
Nonexistent directories are recreated from archived directories
if possible, otherwise they are created with appropriate defaults
for the current user.
Extracted or created directories are initially empty.
.SH CONTROL OPTIONS
.ad
Many of the control options are similar in function to their
.I tar\^
or
.I cpio\^
equivalents.
.PP
Sizes are specified in bytes.
The scale factors
.BR M ,
.BR k ,
or
.BR b ,
can be used to indicate
multiplication by 2**20 (one Megabyte), 1024, or 512 respectively.
Thus
\*(lq10k\*(rq,
\*(lq20b\*(rq,
and
\*(lq10240\*(rq all specify the same number of
bytes.
.TP 10
.BI "\-# " str\^
Use string
.I str\^
as a control string for the built in debugging system.
This option provides information about the internal workings
of
.I bru\^
for the software maintainer or the merely curious.
Some examples are given later.
.TP
.B \-a
Do not reset the
.B access\^
times of disk files that have
been read while performing other actions.
.I Bru
used to
restore the access and modification times of disk files
after they had been read.
Resetting the times prevents defeat of the mechanism used to track
down and remove
\*(lqdead\*(rq files that haven't been accessed in any meaningful way recently.
For various reasons, this flag is now permanently enabled, thus defeating
the preservation of the access time field in the stat structure.
.TP
.BI "\-A " flags\^
Special machine dependent options for the Commodore Amiga.
Current
.I flags\^
are:
.sp 1
.RS 15
.PD 0
.TP 5
.B c
clear file archived bit after processing
.TP 5
.B i
ignore file archived bit for selecting files
.TP 5
.B r
reject files that have archived bit set
.TP 5
.B s
set file archived bit after processing
.RE
.PD 1
.TP
.BI "\-b " bsize\^
Use
.I bsize\^
as the archive input/output
.B buffer\^
size.
The minimum is the size of an archive block (2k or 2048 bytes)
and the maximum is determined by available
memory and I/O device limitations.
If
.I bsize\^
is not an even multiple of 2048 bytes, it will be rounded up.
Normally this option is only required with the
.B \-c\^
mode
since 
.I bru\^
writes this information in the archive header block.
If specified,
.I bsize\^
overrides any existing default value (generally 20k), whether built in or
read from the archive header.
.TP
.B \-B
Useful in shell scripts where
.I bru\^
is run in the
.B background
with no operator present.
Under these conditions,
.I bru\^
simply terminates with appropriate error messages and status,
rather than attempting interaction with the terminal.
.TP
.B \-C
Change the owner
.RB ( chown )
and group of each extracted file to the owner uid and group gid
of the current user.
Normally,
.I bru\^
will restore the owner and group to those recorded in the archive.
This flag causes bru to follow the system default,
with extracted files having the same owner and group as
the user running
.IR bru\^ ,
including Root.
(Under 4.2\ BSD, the default group is that of the directory in
which the file is created.)
.br
.sp
The
.B \-C
option is useful with archives imported from other systems.
In general, it should not be used by the operator or system
administrator when restoring saved files.
Use the
.B \-tv\^
option to see the owner and group of files stored in the archive.
.TP
.B \-D
Causes
.I bru\^
to use double buffering to the archive device on systems that have
System V style shared memory.
Depending upon hardware constraints, double buffering may dramatically
increase the archive device I/O rate, but may adversely affect the
error recovery algorithms.
.TP
.BI "\-f " path\^
Use
.I path\^
as the archive file instead of the default.
If the 
.I path\^
is \*(lq\-\*(rq then
.I bru\^
uses the standard input for archive reading or standard output
for archive writing, as appropriate.
.br
.sp
If multiple
.B \-f
options are given, each
.I path\^
is added to a list of files to cycle through each time a volume
change is required.
When the end of the list is reached,
.I bru\^
automatically cycles back
to the first
.I path\^
and waits for confirmation to continue the cycle again.
Any input other than a carriage return will cause
.I bru\^
to use the newly entered
.I path\^
and to abort the cycling for the remainder of the current run.
.TP
.B \-F
.B Fast\^
mode.
In fast mode, checksum computations and comparisons are disabled.
This mode is useful when the output of one
.I bru\^
is piped to the input of another
.IR bru\^ ,
or when the data integrity of the archive transmission medium is
essentially perfect.
Archives recorded with fast mode enabled must also be read with
fast mode.
Also, be aware that some of the automatic features of
.IR bru\^ ,
such as automatic byte swapping,
are not functional in fast mode.
.TP
.BI "\-I " iopt\^
Set
.B interaction\^
option from
.IR iopt .
Current recognized values for
.I iopt
are:
.sp 1
.RS 15
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI q, fifo
write queries to
.I fifo
.TP 10
.BI r, fifo
read responses from
.I fifo
.TP 10
.BI l, file
write log info to
.I file
.RE
.PD 1
.IP "" 10
The
.B q
and
.B r
options are useful for interacting with
.I bru
when it has been run without a controlling terminal.
See the discussion under
.BR "RUNNING FROM CRON" .
.TP
.BI "\-L " str\^
.B Label\^
the archive with the specified string
.IR str .
.I Str\^
is limited to 63 characters and is usually some
meaningful reminder pertaining to the archive contents.
.TP
.B \-l
Ignore unresolved
.BR links\^ .
Normally bru reports problems with unresolved links
(both regular and symbolic links).
This option suppresses all such complaints.
.TP
.B \-m
Do not cross
.B mounted\^
file system boundaries during expansion
of explicitly named directories.
This option applies only to directories named in 
.IR files .
It limits selection of directory descendants to those
located on the same filesystem as the explicitly named directory.
This option currently applies only to the
.B \-c\^
and
.B \-e\^
modes.
.TP
.BI "\-N " nbits\^
Use
.I nbits\^
as the number of bits for LZW compression if 
.B \-Z\^
is also specified.
The default is to use 12 bits, which is also the minimum
allowable.
The maximum allowable value is 16 bits.
Archives created with more than 12 bits of compression
may be unreadable on smaller systems due to memory
or processor word length constraints.
.TP
.B \-p
.B Pass\^
over files in archive by reading rather than seeking.
Normally 
.I bru\^
will use random access capabilities if available.
This option forces reading instead of seeks.
.TP
.BI "\-P " flags\^
.B Pathname
options that provide explicit control of expansion of
directories, automatic archiving of parent directories,
etc.
Possible characters for
.I flags\^

.TP 5
.B e

.TP 5
.B E

.TP 5
.B f
Disable filter mode.
Builds internal tree of pathnames before doing anything with
the pathnames from the input list.
.TP 5
.B F
Enable filter mode.
Each pathname from the input list is treated individually, and
processing is done with that pathname before the next pathname
is examined.
.TP 5
.B p
Disable automatic archiving of parent directories of explicitly
named files or directories.
.TP 5
.B P
Enable automatic archiving of parent directories of explicitly
named files or directories.
.RE
.PD 1
.IP "" 10
See the discussion under
.BR "DIRECTORIES" .
.TP
.B \-R
.B Remote\^
files are to be
.B excluded
from the archive.
If the system does not support remote filesystems, this
option is ignored.
.TP
.BI "\-s " msize\^
Use
.I msize\^
as the media
.BR size .
The effective media
.B size\^
will be computed from
.I msize\^
since it must be integral multiple of the input/output buffer
size (see the
.B \-b\^
option).
Normally this option is only required with the
.B \-c\^
mode
since 
.I bru\^
writes this information in the archive header block.
If specified,
.I msize\^
overrides any existing default value, whether built
in or read from the archive header.
.TP
.BI "\-S " size\^
Enable options to deal more intelligently with
.B sparse\^
files (files with lots of null bytes).
When used in conjunction with the \-c mode,
turns on automatic file compression for files that are
larger than the specified
.IR size .
When used in conjunction with the \-x mode,
seeks will be used to create blocks of null bytes in the
output file, rather than actually writing null bytes.
See the discussion under
.BR "SPARSE FILES" .
.TP
.B \-v
Enable 
.B verbose\^
mode.
May be specified more than once, as
.BR \-vv\^ ,
.BR \-vvv\^ ,
or
.BR \-vvvv\^ ,
to get even more verbosity.
.TP
.B \-w
.B Wait\^
for confirmation.
.I Bru\^
will print the file name, the action to be taken, and 
.B wait\^
for
confirmation.
Any response beginning with 'y' or 'Y' will cause the action to complete.
Any response beginning with 'g' or 'G' will cause the action to complete
and will reset the \-w option so that no further confirmations will
be requested.
Any other response will abort the action.
.TP
.B \-Z\^
Use LZW file compression.
This is not the default because not all versions of
.I bru\^
know how to deal with compressed files.
When the
.B \-v\^
option is also selected, the compression ratio for each file is
printed as a percentage.
When this flag is used in conjunction with the
.B \-t\^
option on an archive that contains compressed file, the actual archive
file sizes and names are printed,
rather than the original values before archiving.
.br
.sp
A limited amount of backwards compatibility to non-compression
versions of
.I bru\^
is provided.
Archives read by older versions will appear to contain files that
were precompressed prior to archiving.
The public domain
.I compress\^
utility can be used to decompress such files after dearchiving.
.br
.sp
Also see the
.B \-N\^
option.
.SH FILE SELECTION OPTIONS
.ad
The file selection options control which files are selected for processing.
Note that some options are only valid with specific modes.
.TP 10
.BI "\-n " date\^
Select only files
.B newer\^
than
.IR date.
The
.I date\^
is given in one of the forms:
.sp
.TS
l l.
DD\-MMM\-YY\^[,HH:MM:SS]	EX:\ 12\-Mar\-84,12:45:00

.TE
.IP "" 10
The time of day is optional in the first two forms.
If present, it is separated from the date with a comma.
.IP "" 10
If
.I date\^
is really the pathname of a file,
then the modification date of that file will be used instead.
This is useful in automated backups when a dummy file is
\*(lqtouched\*(rq to save the date of last backup.
.TP
.BI "\-o " user\^

Existing directories are never overwritten,
this option merely
allows their attributes to be set back to some
previously existing state.

Selection of symbolic links only implies that the contents of the link
will be modified.  It is currently impossible under 4.2\ BSD
to change access time, modification time, or the file mode of a symbolic

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
Most diagnostics are reasonably informative. 
The most common have to do with meaningless combinations of options,
incompatible options,
hitting memory or device limits,
unresolved file links,
trying to archive or restore something to which access is normally denied,
or problems with media errors and/or archive corruption.
.SH DEVICE TABLE
.ad
.I Bru\^
contains an internal table of known devices and their characteristics.
.I Bru\^
first looks for an environment variable
.BR BRUTAB\^ ,
which contains the name of dynamically loaded file if it begins
with a '/' character, or contains device descriptions if the
first character is not '/'.
If there is no
.B BRUTAB
environment variable, the file
.BR /etc/brutab\^ ,
is loaded.
If neither of the preceding is found, an internal default description
is loaded.
.SH SIGNAL HANDLING
.ad
.I Bru\^
normally catches both interrupt (SIGINT) and quit (SIGQUIT).
When interrupt is caught during archive creation or extraction,
.I bru\^
completes its work on the current file before cleaning up and exiting.
This is the normal way of aborting
.IR bru .
When a quit signal is caught an immediate exit is taken.
.PP
Note that during file extraction, a quit signal may leave the last file only
partially extracted.
Similarly, a quit signal during archive writing may leave the archive
truncated.
When either interrupt or quit is caught at any other time
an immediate exit is taken.  
.SH ERROR RECOVERY
.ad
When properly configured for a given software/hardware environment,
bru can recover from most common errors.
For example, attempts to use unformatted media are detected, allowing
substitution of formatted media.
Random blocks in an archive can be deliberately overwritten (corrupted)
without affecting
.IR bru 's
ability to recover data from the rest of the archive.
When I/O errors are detected, retries are performed automatically.
Out of order sequencing on multi-volume archive reads is detected,
allowing replacement with the correct volume.
.SH DIRECTORIES
.ad
There are two actions
.I bru\^
takes with respect to directories, that make creation and extraction
of entire hierarchies of files more convenient and complete.
These actions are automatic archiving of parent directories and
automatic expansion of explicitly named directories.
.PP
Automatic archiving of parent directories means that when
.I bru\^
is given the complete pathname of a file to archive, it
attempts to automatically archive all parent directory nodes necessary
to fully restore the specified file.
During extraction, any required directories which do not
already exist are restored from the archive if possible,
otherwise they are created with appropriate defaults for
the current user.
When
.I bru\^
reads it's list of files from the standard input, or when
the \-Pp option is given,
this automatic archiving of parent directory nodes is suppressed.
Note also, that when creating archives with additional constraints
on the selected files (such as use of the \-n option),
these parent directories may be excluded.
.PP
Automatic expansion of explicitly named directories means that when
.I bru\^
is given an explicit file name that names a directory node, not only
is that directory node archived, but all files and subdirectories
in that directory are archived.
I.E., the entire file hierarchy rooted in the explicitly named
directory is archived.
When
.I bru\^
reads it's list of files from the standard input, or when
the \-Pe option is given,
this automatic expansion of directories is suppressed.
.PP
Note that incremental archives,
archives created with the \-Pp option,
or archives created from a list of files supplied on the standard input
stream, 
may not contain all of the necessary parent directories to replicate
the original hierarchy and thus
may result in creation of directories with the default
attributes when files are extracted from the archive.
.PP
When
.I bru\^
reads the list of
.I files\^
from the standard input stream, the
default values for the \-P options are \-PeFp, which turns off
expansion of directories, turns on filter mode, and turns off automatic archiving
of parent directories.
This allows
.I bru\^
to be conveniently used to archive only filesystem nodes
that are explicitly named on the input list.
.PP
When
.I files\^
are explicitly  named on the command line (or default to '.'), the
default values for the \-P options are \-PEfP, which turns on
expansion of directories, turns off filter mode, and turns on automatic archiving
of parent directories.
This is typically the most convenient behavior for arguments
given on the command line.
.SH WILDCARDS
.ad
When
.B reading
archives
.I bru\^
recognizes file name generation patterns in the same format as
the shell.
This allows greater flexibility in specifying files to be extracted,
compared, or listed.
As a special extension to shell type expansion, the sense of the match
is reversed for patterns that begin with '!'.
.PP
Note that the patterns may have to be quoted to prevent expansion by the
shell.
Also note that patterns are processed independently, without regard for
any other patterns that may or may not be present.
In particular,
"/bin/a*  /bin/b*" is equivalent to "/bin/[ab]*", but
"/bin/!a* /bin/!b*" is equivalent to "/bin/*",
.B not
"/bin/![ab]*".
.SH BYTE/WORD SWAPPING
.ad
While reading archives produced on other machines,
.I bru\^
automatically attempts to perform byte and/or word swapping as
necessary.
.SH REMOTE TAPE DRIVES
.ad
On 4.2\ BSD systems, and System V systems that support networking,
.I bru\^
allows the use of remote tape drives for the archive device
(via the
.B \-f
option).
A remote tape drive file name has the form
.RS
.sp
.IR system [. user ]:/dev/???
.sp
.RE
where
.I system
is the remote system,
the optional
.I user
is the login name to use on the remote system if different
from the current user's login name, and
.B /dev/???
is the tape drive to use (1600 BPI or 800 BPI, raw or blocked,
rewinding or non-rewinding, etc.).
In all cases, the user must have the appropriate permissions
on the remote system.
(See also the
.SM
.B CAVEATS
section, below.)
.SH RUNNING FROM CRON
.ad
Sometimes it is convenient to run
.I bru
under conditions where there is no controlling terminal.
This can be a problem if interaction is needed, such as
when switching to a new volume.
As an example, consider the case of running
.I bru
from
.IR cron ,
where the operator mounts a tape before leaving in the
evening, and
.I bru
writes the first volume in the middle of the night.
When returning in the morning, the operator wants to be
able to mount a second tape if necessary, and instruct
.I bru
to continue.
.PP
If no interaction with the user is required, 
running from cron is no different than running directly from
a terminal.
However, when interaction is necessary
there are basically two options; terminate, or find some
way to communicate with the operator (or another program
masquerading as the operator).
The
.B \-B
option provides for simple termination.
The
.B \-I
options provide for communication with an operator.
.PP
On systems that support fifos, a pair of fifos are used to send
requests and receive replies.
Before running
.IR bru ,
create a pair of fifos with the commands:
.PP
.RS
mknod /dev/bru.q p
.br
mknod /dev/bru.r p
.RE
.PP
Then, add the arguments \*(lq-Iq,/dev/bru.q -Ir,/dev/bru.r\*(rq to the
desired bru command line which ultimately gets executed under
.IR cron .
The first time
.I bru
needs to communicate with an operator, it will open the two fifos, write
a query to the bru.q fifo, and wait for a response from the bru.r fifo.
A simple program provided with bru, called
.I brutalk
can be used to read the query and send a reply:
.PP
.RS
brutalk </dev/bru.q >/dev/bru.r
.RE
.PP
The
.I brutalk
program will continue to read queries and send replies until either
.I bru
exits, or a control-D (EOF) is typed at the terminal.
.SH EXIT CODES
.ad
.I Bru\^
always returns meaningful status as follows:
.PP
.RS
0\ \ \ \ Normal exit, no errors or warnings.
.br
1\ \ \ \ Warnings (or interrupted).
.br
2\ \ \ \ Errors (or quit signal).
.RE
.SH SPARSE FILES
.ad
With the UNIX filesystem, it is possible to create files which take
up much less space in the filesystem than their size would indicate.
These files are generally known as
.B sparse
files, and are common in database or scientific applications.
.br
.sp
For example, it is perfectly acceptable to create an empty file, seek to
an offset 1Mb from the start of the file, and then write a single
byte of data at that point, thus creating a file one byte more than
1Mb in length, with the first 1Mb being null bytes that are not
actually stored in separately allocated blocks in the filesystem.
.sp
Without using the \-S option,
.I bru\^
would archive this file using 1Mb of archive space, and on extraction,
would create a file that actually takes up 1Mb of space in the
filesystem.
.sp
With the \-S option,
.I bru\^
will automatically compress this file down to about 4Kb in the archive,
and on extraction, will use seeks to recreate the sparse file, thus
saving about 1Mb of space in the filesystem.
.sp
The \-S option is not the default because not all systems on which
.I bru\^
runs can support sparse files, and because the overhead of
compressing all files larger than the autocompression threshold
can be significant.
.sp
Note that this option is also useful even when sparse files are
not expected, since it can be used during archive creation to
selectively compress files larger than a specified size.
This is generally faster than compressing every file, while
still saving considerable space in the archive, since large
files generally tend to compress better than small ones.

.SH UNIX SYSTEM INCOMPATIBILITIES
.hy
.I Bru\^
recognizes special file types that may be allowed on one type of
.B UNIX\^
system, but not on another.
For instance, on a 4.2\ BSD system,
.I bru\^
will extract
fifos as plain files (mode 0666, as modified by the
.IR umask\^ ),
and issue an appropriate error message.
Usually,
.I bru\^
will issue two messages.
The first message will be the more descriptive of the two.
.PP
Under System V, when
.I bru\^
sees a symbolic link,
it will check to see if the file to be linked to exists,
and is not a directory.
If so, it will attempt to make a hard link.
If the hard link fails,
.I bru\^
will issue a warning.
.PP
Pyramid corporation conditional symbolic links are also supported.
On a Pyramid, they are restored properly.
On a 4.2\ BSD system,
.I bru\^
will attempt a symbolic link for the file given in the UCB universe.
Under System V,
it will attempt a hard link for the file given in the ATT universe
(with the same constraints as when attempting to restore regular
symbolic links).
.PP
Currently, the only different
.B UNIX\^
systems that
.I bru\^
fully understands are System V, 4.2\ BSD, and Pyramid's OSx.
.SH CAVEATS
.ad
Pathnames are limited to 1023 characters in length.
For linked files, the limit applies to the combined total of the
first link found and the link currently being processed, if both
of them exceed the previous 127 character maximum, otherwise the
limit applies to the link with the longest pathname.
When earlier versions with a 127 character limit read archives
produced by the 1023 character version, they will see a truncated
pathname with the prefix "brutmp/".
.br
.sp
Implementation differences complicate the algorithms for
automatic detection of end of file on devices.
The algorithms can be fooled, hence the 
.B \-s\^
option.
.br
.sp
Special files moved to a machine other than their original host
will generally be useless and possibly even dangerous.
This goes double for symbolic links.
.br
.sp
When extracting files from archives, patterns used to match
directories may result in some unnecessary directories being
extracted.
For example, if the pattern is \*(lqa/*/c\*(rq, and the directory
\*(lqa/b\*(rq is encountered in the archive, the directory file \*(lqa/b\*(rq
will be extracted since it will be needed when (and if)
the file \*(lqa/b/c\*(rq is encountered.
When in doubt, use the
.B \-w\^
option.
.br
.sp
In order to be able to efficiently archive needed directories,
.I bru\^
builds an image of the directory tree for
.I files\^
using dynamically allocated memory.
Since there may be at most 5120 characters passed on the command line,
it is very unlikely that
.I bru\^
will run out of memory while building the tree from command line arguments.
This is not true of file lists read from the standard input,
particularly on machines with limited address space.
.br
.sp
Information about file linkages is also kept in memory.
Some linkages may be lost if memory is exhausted.
.br
.sp
Since
.I bru\^
is owned by root
and runs with \*(lqset\ user\ id\*(rq to allow it to create directories
and special files, it makes every attempt to prevent normal users
from archiving or extracting files they would normally not have access to.
There may be loopholes.
Also note that
anyone with physical or electronic access to an archive,
and knowledge of the archive structure,
can recover
any of its contents by writing their own file extraction program.
.br
.sp
Directories which have filesystems mounted on them will not
be properly archived until the filesystem is unmounted.
This is not generally a problem.
.br
.sp
Explicitly naming both a directory and one of its 
descendants will cause the descendant to be archived twice,
unless they are on separate filesystems and the
.B \-m\^
flag is used.
.br
.sp
Explicitly naming a file more than once is ineffective.
.br
.sp
When reading from the raw magnetic tape file (rmtxxx)
.I bru\^
automatically attempts to adjust the I/O buffer size to match
that used to record the archive.
Under certain circumstances it may fail and require help via the
.B \-b\^
option.
.br
.sp
The 4.2\ BSD remote magnetic tape protocol, rmt(8), allows
writing and reading of no more than 10K bytes, so
.BR \-b 10k
must be specified when reading from or writing to a remote tape drive.
Also, using remote tape drives can be slow.

This could become a chronic problem under 4.2\ BSD.
