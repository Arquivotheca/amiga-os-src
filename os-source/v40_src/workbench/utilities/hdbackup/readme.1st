This is the first alpha version of BRUshell.  The docs may not entirely
reflect the reality of the code, as I didn't have a chance to go through
them in detail.  Be sure to copy the BRUshell.config file to your s: 
directory.  If you are using a previous version of bru, you should update
to the executable supplied here, as there are a couple of new features
that BRUshell makes use of.
