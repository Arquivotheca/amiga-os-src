(1)	The Lattice 5.02 compiler has inconsistent declarations for
	AllocWBObject in <proto/icon.h> (where it was defined as
	returning a struct WBObject) and <workbench/icon.h> (where
	it was defined as returning a pointer to a struct WBObject).
	To resolve this, I changed my <proto/icon.h> to match the
	<workbench/icon.h> version.

	Ditto for AddFreeList, changed it to void.
