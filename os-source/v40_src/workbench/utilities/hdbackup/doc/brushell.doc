The menu item "Auto Trim Tree" will, when selected, cause files which
were shadowed, de-selected, or which had a 'write error' to be trimmed
from the directory tree prior to saving the logfile.  This trimming will
happen immediatly after the backup is performed.

Files will be hilighted in a 3rd color during a restore, if they were
not backed up in the backup which created the logfile.  Of course, if
the "Auto Trim Tree" option was set, they will not appear at all.

The file inclusion/exclusion gadgets are ANDed together.  I.E., if the
size gadget is selected and set to greater than 100, and the date
gadget is also selected and set to after 11-Nov-88, only files which
meet both criteria will be acted upon by a click of the Include or
Exclude gadgets.  A time can also be set.  The format for the date
and time string is:  DD-MMM-YY HH:MM:SS   Leading zeros are not needed.


The inclusion/exclusion criteria are now also used during the
building of the directory tree in memory.  The running file display
and tally while the directory is being scanned is pre-filter.


Options can be set on the command line as well as in the
ToolArray of the icon.  A global config file is also supported in the
S: directory.  The order of precedence is as follows:

	1. Command line options
	2. Icon file options
	3. File S:BRUshell.config options
	4. Internal defaults


Note that a null option (i.e. "SCREEN=") will cause the default to be
used.  For example, if no configuration options are given anywhere, the
SCREEN option defaults to SCREEN=custom.  If the S: file contains
the option SCREEN=workbench, and a command line option of the form
SCREEN= is given, the subsequent S: file option will be ignored and a
custom screen will be used.


A directory may be "shadowed" by single-clicking it.  This causes the
contents, be they directorys or files, to be ignored.  They will not
be included in backups, nor will exclusions or inclusions which are
performed affect them.  One use for this would be to protect a directorys
contents from the effects of an inclusion or exclusion.


A double click is used to descend into a directory.  Double clicking
a directory will always result in it's being un-shadowed.

Double-clicking on a file will bring up a requester which contains more
information about that file.  The file state (selected or not) ends up
as it started out prior to the double-click.

		CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

BRUPATH=<name>
	example:	BRUPATH=dh3:utilities/est
				BRU=c:
				BRU=HDutils:

This allows specifying an explicit path to find BRU.  Note that this path
is limited to 64 characters.  It also may NOT contain spaces.  If this
option is not used, BRUshell will search for BRU first in the directory
containing BRUshell, and then in "c:".

BRU=<name>
	example:	BRU=bru
			BRU=bru.dbug

This allows an alternate name for the bru executable to be given.  The
default is "bru".

BRUARGS=<argument-list>
	example:	BRUARGS=-#d:t:F:L:o,bru.log

This allows some user specified arguments to be passed to bru by brushell.
Not very useful for the most part, except for debugging purposes.

BRUSTACK=<value>
	example:	BRUSTACK=40000

This allows a specific stack size to be set for the bru process by brushell.
The default is to use the same stack size as brushell if BRUSTACK is not
given.

DEVS=<name>|[name|][name|][name|]
	example:	DEVS=worm:|tape:

This allows adding device names to the "devices" menu in addition to
to the pre-existing ones DF0: thru DF3:.  A total of 4 additional
devices can be added to this menu.
Note: This must come *before* a USE= option statement.



USE=<name>|[name|][...]
	example:	USE=df0:|df1:|df2:

Specify the names of backup devices to use.  These devices should
already exist on the device menu, either by virtue of being the
default devices which are always there, or by having been defined in
a previous DEVS= option.



FONTNAME=<name>
	example:   FONTNAME=topaz



FONTSIZE=<num>
	example:   FONTSIZE=8

The font can be any height from 6 to 15, but the width MUST be 8.
Obviously this precludes use of proportional fonts.



SCREEN=custom
SCREEN=workbench
	This will cause the workbench screen or a custom screen
	to be used.



NUMCOLORS=4
NUMCOLORS=8
	Causes either 4 or 8 colors to be used for the custom
	screen. 
	Has no effect if  SCREEN=workbench



LACE=on
LACE=off
	Controls wether or not the custom screen is (USA) 200 lines
	high or (USA) 400 lines high.  This will also affect the
	colors used. (Probably want different colors than for a
	non-interlaced screen!)



COLORS=<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>
	example:   COLORS=000,458,FFF,800,7FF,AA3,8B2,111

	Set the colors for the custom screen.  The number is of
	the format Red-Green-Blue, in hex.
	For example, black would be 000, white would be FFF.
	All colors MUST be specified if this parameter is used.



LACECOLORS=<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>,<num>
	example:   COLORS=000,458,FFF,800,7FF,AA3,8B2,111

	Set the colors for the custom screen which will be used if
	LACE=on is set.  The number is of the format Red-Green-Blue,
	in hex.
	For example, black would be 000, white would be FFF.
	All colors MUST be specified if this parameter is used.



BACKUP=[volume[path]]
RESTORE=[volume[path]]
	Causes BRUshell to automaticly and immediatly go into the desired
	mode and begin building the tree.



START=on
START=off
	If set to on, the operation set by specifing the BACKUP= or the
	RESTORE= option will commence automaticly.  Otherwise the tree
	is merely built, than the user must start the backup.



/* The following is probably not an option the end-user will have. DTM. */
DEBUG=on
DEBUG=off
DEBUG=on|pause
	If on, debug info will print out to the CLI (if started from
	one), or the serial port if started from WorkBench.
	If the pause keyword is given, a key must be pressed after
	each line of debug info prints before the program will continue.
	If you start from WorkBench with "DEBUG=on|pause" you had better
	have a terminal hooked to the serial port!  BRUshell will look
	as though it hung if you don't!




*** Case is significant for both pieces of the option spec.
*** There should also be no spaces in the option spec.

Defaults are:	DEBUG=off
		LACE=off
		SCREEN=custom
		FONT=topaz
		FONTSIZE=8
		NUMCOLORS=8
		START=off
		DEVS=df0:|df1:df2:|df3:
		USE=df0:
		BRU=""


-------------------------------------------------------------------

		AREXX PORT

An ARexx port by the name of "BRU_SHELL" is opened by BRUshell.
To get the returns from these, the ARexx command "options results"
must be given.  If this is not set, error codes will be returned
from the commands which pass back a result.



	Commands:


STATUS <NODE|FILE>
	NODE Returns: "<node_count> <memsize> <entrys> <max_entrys>"
	FILE Returns: "<total_count> <total_size> <sel_count> <sel_size>"


PATH
	Returns: "<current_path>"


ROOT
	Returns: "address of the root tree node"


DEBUG <ON|OFF|PAUSE|NOPAUSE>
	Returns: none

	Used to change the state of the debug flags "on the fly".


VOLUME
	Returns: <volume name being backed up>



					------------------


ERRORMSG <text>
	Returns: none



QUERYMSG <text>
	Returns: <string typed by user>



FILENAME <RELATIVE|ABSOLUTE>
	Returns: <path and filename>

	This is the next filename to be backed up, pre-pended with a path
	relative to the volume (returned by command VOLUME) or pre-pended
	by an absolute volume and path.
	The default is for a relative path name to be given.



FINISHED
	Returns: none

	This tells BRUshell that BRU is ready to terminate.  If recieved
	while a backup is in progress, this aborts the backup.
