USAGE:
    GRAPHICDUMP [TINY|SMALL|MEDIUM|LARGE|xdots:ydots]

PURPOSE:
    To do a raster dump of the front screen

SPECIFICATION:
    GRAPHICDUMP is a tool to do a raster dump of the frontmost (or only)
    Intuition creen to the graphic printer selected in Preferences.
    If the program is run from WorkBench or without any arguments from
    CLI then printing will commence after a 10 second pause (to allow
    the user to insure that the screen to print is the frontmost).

    There are five options from which the user may choose when using
    GRAPHICDUMP from CLI:

	TINY	Make the width of the resulting printout about 1/4
		the total width allowed by the printer.  The height
		is such that the screen's original aspect ratio is
		maintained.

	SMALL	Make the width of the resulting printout about 1/2
		the total width allowed by the printer.  The height
		is such that the screen's original aspect ratio is
		maintained.

	MEDIUM	Make the width of the resulting printout about 3/4
		the total width allowed by the printer.  The height
		is such that the screen's original aspect ratio is
		maintained.

	LARGE	Make the width of the resulting printout be the full
		width allowed by the printer.  The height is such
		that the screen's original aspect ratio is maintained.

	xdots:ydots Use xdots as the absolute width in dots; use ydots
		as the absolute height in dots.  This allows the user to
		specify any dimensions within the confines of the printer.

EXAMPLES:
     To produce a printout of the frontmost screen whose width is half
     that of the printer's maximum:
     1>GRAPHICDUMP MEDIUM

     To produce a printout of the frontmost screen that is ? dots in
     width and ? dots in height:
     1>GRAPHICDUMP 640 200
