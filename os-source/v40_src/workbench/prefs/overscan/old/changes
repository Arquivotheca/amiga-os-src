This is the first release of Overscan Preferences for 2.1.

Size: 15084 bytes (1344 bytes smaller than 2.04)

* Verified that the changes since this copy of the source was split
off have been correctly re-integrated.

* The default view position and preferred mode for editing now come
from the graphics database, instead of being coded into Overscan.
This is required in order to support future monitors (eg. 72 Hz).

* As a result, now requires V37 Kickstart.

* Overscan now handles monitor types that are unknown to it.

* Major rework of the structures that are allocated.  Much less
tangled and confusing.  Now allocates exactly one structure per
monitor.  Eliminates the per-mode allocation (vestigal code).

* Other obsolete stuff removed (eg. mode-naming, VideoOScan tracking).

* Now thinks in terms of explicit NTSC and PAL, instead of "default
plus explicit other".

* On the edit-screen, only the active handle remains visible during
dragging.  This is much faster, which makes a big difference on slower
processors.

* On the edit-screen, the menu button now cancels a sizing/moving
operation.

* On the edit-screen, fixed mouse-queue problems (no longer set
mouse-queue to 1).  Also, for MOUSEMOVEs, I now grab the mouse-coords
from the window instead of the message, to be most up-to-date.

* Now uses AllocAslRequestTags() instead of AllocFileRequest() and
"illegal" poking of struct FileRequest.  Handles refresh while the
file requester is up.

* Puts up a dummy-requester to block input while the Asl requester is
up.  The same is true while the edit-screen is up.

* Now opens utility.library and uses CXD and CXM stubs from utility.

* Added Chk_Abort() to sprintf.asm.

* Straightened out krinkly arrows in scrolling list.

* On the edit screen, the unusable area (outside MaxOScan) is now
completely black, instead of part black and part gray.  As a
side-effect, the Overscan editor can no longer use the first two
Workbench colors for its edit screen.
