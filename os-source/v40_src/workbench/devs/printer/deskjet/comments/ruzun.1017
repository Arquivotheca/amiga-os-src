Carolyn,

[Out of colored ink again, but worth it this time! :-) ]

  Thank you so much for uploading the latest driver version.  It 
fixes almost all the previous driver problems.  The only remaining
issues, are to provide for optimal threshold settings,
allowing CYM to use the same table when doing gamma correction
and allowing Cyan to have its own table when doing linear corrections,
and to lighten the greyscale graphic dumps (those made with the
black ink cartridge).

For most general use I found a correction of Linear -4 for YM,
and Linear -5 for Cyan, with the density set to 7, gives the optimal
results on paintjet paper.

Here are my findings on color printouts:

For Linear Correction, always keep Cyan at one level greater in
magnitude than the Yellow and Magenta inks.
That is I keep a value of 0x18314020 in location $111C when
doing linear corrected dumps.  Useful Threshold values are

10 - Linear Minus 2 for YM, Linear Minus 3 for C
11 - Linear Minus 3 for YM, Linear Minus 4 for C
12 - Linear Minus 4 for YM, Linear Minus 5 for C 
13 - Linear Minus 5 for YM, Linear Minus 6 for C

In addition, some pictures look better balanced when using
Gamma correction.  when using a gamma table the SAME 
correction must be applied to each ink color.

Useful gamma threshold settings are:

5 - 1.5 Gamma for CYM
6 - 1.6 gamma for CYM
7 - 1.7 gamma for CYM



On all printouts the following settings yield optimal results:

Green and Blue Color Correction ON
Red Color Correction OFF

Density = 6 is good for some bitmaps, but most bitmaps
look best with Density = 7 when using paintjet paper.


------
The problems with grey scale dumps crashing is no longer
present, the problem with having to have smoothing on is
no longer present, both grey scale and smoothing now work fine.

-------

For Greyscale dumps, a simple linear -2 to linear -5 correction
should be applied to the bitmaps, or considerable detail is lost.
It should be somewhat easier to do than the color correction was,
and if it is done, this will be a single driver that will work
for all DeskJet users.  As it stands, it is not feasible to use
this driver for most grey scale graphic dumps, since considerable
detail is lost due to the density of the printouts.
