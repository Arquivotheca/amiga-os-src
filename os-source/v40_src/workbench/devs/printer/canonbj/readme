Contents and Updates:
---------------------
This driver is intended for all Canon compatible inkjet printers
(BJ-10e, BJ10ex, BJ300, BJ330, Brother HJ100, HJ 770).  For
getting the latest version ask Canon.  In case you own a modem,
you can allways download the latest version for free from

             1200-14400bps HST/V32/V32.bis
             Setting: 8N1

In case you own Kickstart 2.0, you can find out the driver version
by using the CLI 'version devs:printers/<drivername>' command.

Files you must get with this readme:

   Install (+.info)      -    Install program for workbench users
   Readme                -    This textfile

Installation
------------
1. Install and connect the printer as described in the printer manual.
2. Set the printer dip-switches as descibed below:

     1       Auto sheet feeder          ---
     2       Graphics image density     ---
     3       Automatic  line feed       off
     4       Page length                ---
     5       Character Set              off
     6       Automatic carriage return  off
     7       Alternat graphics mode     off
     8       buffer/download memory     off
     9       Code page                  on
    10       Printer control mode       on

    --- = depends on your installation

   In case you select download memory instead of receive buffer
   (DIP switch 8 on), you are not able to print graphics!

3. Boot your Amiga with your normaly used system disk.
4. Insert the Canon driver disk and select the drawer of your
   printer.
5. Doubleclick the 'Install' program. The 'Install' program
   will copy the driver on your system disk. Sometimes there is no
   disk space free on the system disk and the install program will
   pop up a requester telling so. In this case free up some disk
   space on your system disk by deleting unused files.

   In case you are a CLI user, simply copy the driver into your
   "devs:printers" directory.

6. Now start preferences on your system disk (if you own Kickstart 2.0
   use the 'Printer' preference program). Select the BJ10
   driver and adjust all other preference parameters to your
   environment. See your system manual for more information about
   the preference program.

General information about this driver/printer
---------------------------------------------
1. inkjet printer b&w/greyscale printer (text and graphics).
2. The driver supports graphic dumps in following densities:

     Density   XDPI    YDPI      XYDPI
        1       360     360     129600
        2       180     180      32400
        3       120     360      43200
        4       180     360      64800
        5       240     360      86400
        6       360     180      64800
        7       360     360     129600

3. A PaperSize of 'Wide Tractor' selects a maximum print width of
   13.6 inches (for wide carriage printers).
   Note: 'Wide Tractor' is only implemented for future Canon
   printers. The BJ10e printer is not capable of doing this. 
4. A papertype of 'SINGLE' ejects the sheet with a formfeed after every
   dump.  Formfeed after a graphic dump is send according to the
   SPECIAL_NOFORMFEED flag.
5. Thanks to special code done in this driver, the driver
   automaticly makes use of the improved features of
   68020/30/40 processors. There is absolutly no more need for
   a "turbo" version of the driver, because everything is built in.
   During initialisation, the driver finds out wich processor type
   is currently used and if it is run on an improved processer
   (i.e. 68020,68030 or 68040), it uses the optimised turbo routines.
   These routines take care of new instructions and performance
   increase by using the processor cache.
6. IMPORTANT: Letter/Draft prefs setting also affects graphic dumps. So
   if you get light grey dumps instead of real black, check your
   setting. This is a feature, not a bug!

Supported commands
------------------
1. There is support for selecting different typefaces.  Due
   to the extended character translation table, the character set
   selection commands (aFNT0 - aFNT10) are really no longer needed.
   The following fonts are yet supported:

   aFNT  Code           BJ10

    0  - ESC(B - Resident 10cpi HQ (default)
    1  - ESC(R - Resident 12cpi HQ
    2  - ESC(K - Resident 17cpi HQ
    3  - ESC(A - Resident proportional HQ
    4  - ESC(E - Download 10 cpi economy
    5  - ESC(H - Download 12 cpi economy
    6  - ESC(Y - Download 17 cpi economy
    7  - ESC(Z - Download 10 cpi HQ
    8  - ESC(J - Download 12 cpi HQ
    9  - ESC(6 - Download 17 cpi HQ
   10  - ESC(C - Download proportional HQ

Hints & bug reports
-------------------
1. Pagestream 2.1 users must select density 0 in the print menu
   to finaly get density 1 (360*360DPI).
2. In case of stripes and empty lines check your printer
   margins (DIP switches, preferences setting, settings within
   the program you use,...).
3. Don't mix sending commands to the printer through parallel.device
   (par:) and printer.device (prt:)! You likely confuse
   the printer!
4. In case you found a bug:  please enclose your bug report a
   full description (driver revision, preference settings,...).
   In most cases we can't verify your report without an example!
   In case you own Kickstart 2.0, you can also get the driver version
   by using the CLI 'version' command.
5. If you are interested in buying AmigaTeX from Radical Eye
   Software, you should buy the dvipref AmigaTeX driver. This
   driver also needs the 360*360 fonts which come with the dvip6
   driver.
6. In case you have more wishes, hints or reports, send them to the
   above address...
