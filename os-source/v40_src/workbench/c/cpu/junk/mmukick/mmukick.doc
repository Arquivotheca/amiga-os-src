				MMUkick

USAGE:
    MMUkick kick.XXx.f0

PURPOSE:
    To kick a new version of kickstart using the MMU.

PROCEDURE:
    Boot up with whatever kickstart version you have in ROM, and stop
    the startup sequence as soon as possible. Then enter "MMUkick file"
    at the CLI prompt. The computer will reboot with two quick series
    of LED flashes.

    As soon as you have rebooted, stop the startup-sequence again and
    enter the command "MMUkick" once again. (no file is necessary.

    One simply way of avoid this hassle is to put "MMUkick file" as the
    first instruction in the startup-sequence. The first time the line
    is executed, the computer reboots with the new kickstart file. After
    the reboort, this command copies the kickstart image from its
    temporary location in chip ram and places it in fast ram.

    As long as the "MMUkick" instruction is not executed after the reboot,
    the kickstart image is unprotected in rom. That is why the command
    should be executed quickly upon boot-up.

EXAMPLES:
    1> mmukick kick.24v.f0

    [press the two mouse buttons to get a boot-up screen]

    [choose a device to boot from]

    [stop the startup-sequence and type "mmukick" at the cli prompt]

    [enjoy the new kickstart!]
