               AMIGA BUG REPORT   CBM SOFTWARE NEW PRODUCT ASSURANCE

Name:	Joe O'Hara					Date:  4/12/88

Product: A2090/A2090A Hard Disk Device Driver

Bug Location: Hardware      [ ]		Software (HDDISK 34.3       ) [x]
              Documentation [ ]		Other  (specify below)        [ ]

Configuration: Number of Disks  1       Revs:	34.5	Kickstart
               Chip Memory	0.5MB		34.4	Workbench
               Fast Memory	2.0MB		 3.8	Motherboard
               SemiFast Memory  0.5MB
               Other Equipment: Rodime 3057S

Brief Bug Description:

	Anomalies prepping/formatting Rodime 3057S.

	Can't prep unit with ROM-based driver. Prep returns
	"Device not PREPed" (Preps OK with disk-based driver).

	Formatting failures using the partitions defined in the attached
	mountlist. Results are summarized in the following table.

	Partition	Controller	Result

	RRES2:		A2090A		OK
	RFFS:		A2090A		"Not a DOS disk" requester during
					initialization.
	RRES2:		A2090		"RRES: not validated" requester
					during initialization.
	RFFS:		A2090		"Not a DOS disk" requester during
					initialization.

Bug Generation Procedure:

	1. Drive prepped, first partition formatted 2-100
	2. Mount RFFS: from rodime-mountlist (see below)
	3. Format drive rffs: name "FastFile"
	4. Observe requester after format and during initialization.

Related Bugs:

	Using A2090, formatting second (standard) partition (RRES2:) over
	existing partition (RFFS:) which is not mounted.

	1. Mount rres2: from rodime-mountlist
	2. Format drive rres2: name "RO2"
	3. Program prompts to insert disk and <return>
	4. As formatting begins, the following two requesters are
	   displayed:

		1) Replace volume
		   RFFS
		   in drive 3

		2) Please replace volume
		   RFFS
		   in any drive

	5. At the completion of format, an "RRES2 not validated" requester
	   is displayed.
	6. Rebooting the system shows that RRES2 is a valid DOS disk, but
	   lacks trashcan directory and icon.

Mountlist used for Rodime 3057S:

	RRES:	Device = hddisk.device
		Unit = 3
		Flags = 0
		Surfaces = 5
		BlocksPerTrack = 26
		Reserved = 2
		Interleave = 0
		LowCyl = 0 ; HighCyl = 1
		Buffers = 30
		BufMemType = 1
	#

	RFFS:	Device = hddisk.device
		FileSystem = L:FastFileSystem
		Unit = 3
		Flags = 0
		Surfaces = 5
		BlocksPerTrack = 26
		Reserved = 2
		Interleave = 0
		LowCyl = 101 ; HighCyl = 679
		Buffers = 30
		GlobVec = -1
		BufMemType = 1

	I need some International insight.
	
	Currently, we have several "keyboard shortcuts" or editing keys
	that we detect using raw scancodes.  Does this present a problem
	for other countries.  For example, we say "right-amiga Q" means
	"undo a string buffer."  Do foreign manuals contain a translation
	or does 'Q' just happen to be at the same scan code on all keyboards?
	
	I expect that we'll always use scan codes for things like DELETE, RETURN,
	BACKSPACE, CURSOR keys, and HELP (someday).  I wonder about the more
	alphabetic ones.
	
	They currently include (but might grow):
	
	rightA-Q	-	undo string gadget
	rightA-X	-	kill string gadget
	leftA-M		-	workbench to front (?)
	leftA-N		-	workbench to back (?)
	leftA-B		-	cancel autorequester
	leftA-V		-	retry autorequester
	
	Should these be scancode based or keymap based.  They are scancode based
	right now.  If it doesn't matter for these keys, what about future keys.
	
	We also need to form some guidelines for applications using the
	new hooks for controlling editing.
	
	Thanks.
