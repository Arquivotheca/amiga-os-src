this directory contains the source to the A2090A hddisk.device
which can either be burned into roms or loaded into expansion drawer.

functions merged 01.21.88 by bart in order to facilitate maintenence of code
and to keep versions consistent between disk and rom based drivers.

added 10 reserved/noio vectors after v1.2 vectors and prior to scsi direct

non-unique name problems fixed, for autoboot and disk-based driver. 

disk-based driver checks dos devinfo list for previously mounted disks with
the same name.

driver attempts to recognize 7 scsi units per controller (0..6)

buffered i/o: attempt to dma single blocks to buffer if larger transfers fail.

driver supports multiple controller access (0..9)

scsi format was always addressing target addr 0 for format drive due to
failure to reset cmd lun which was being cleared by setup for setmodecmd.

Subject: variable sized buffers are an enhancement (deferred)
the  hddisk driver should support variable sized buffers
currently set to 8 fixed size 8 block buffers

overscan i/o: attempt to dma single blocks to disk if larger transfers fail.

scsi "service required" interrupt handled by "stub" routine in a timely fashion.

idle loop allows scsi drives to spin up.
