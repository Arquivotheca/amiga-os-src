 ***********************  Release Notes   *******************************

This disk contains the 1942Setup program that updates Release 3 of the
Amiga Operating System to ensure maximum performance from the 1940 and
1942 monitors.

To execute the 1942Setup program, double-click on the 1942Setup icon. Be
sure to reboot your system after running the 1942Setup program before
making changes with the new Overscan Preferences editor described below.


1942Setup updates the following monitor files:

	DblNTSC
	DblPAL
	Euro36
	Euro72
	Multiscan
	NTSC
	PAL
	VGAOnly

If they are found in SYS:Devs/Monitors or SYS:Storage/Monitors, they are
updated there. Otherwise, the script will update them on the Storage3.0 disk
(included with the Amiga Operating System distribution disk set). Note that
this disk must be write-enabled for this update to succeed.

In addition, the Overscan Preferences editor is also updated.  The "Edit
Text  Size" and "Edit Graphics Size" screens now have an arrow gadget which
allows you to shift the display area up, down, right, and left to center it.
You can move the entire display in the direction of the arrows by clicking
on them.  It is possible to move the display too far to the right or left,
resulting in fading colors or a total disruption of the display.  If this
happens, you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the display back
into position or press the Escape key, which undoes any changes you made and
returns to the Overscan editor screen.  Note that moving the display too far
can cause some monitors--but not the 1940/1942--to go out of sync.
Because this condition can damage some monitors, it is important not to
leave them this way for any period of time.


To correctly position the display on your 1940 and 1942 monitors:

    1.  Regardless of your intended display mode choice, begin by selecting
	NTSC from the Monitor Types list gadget.
    2.  Center the display using the controls on the 1940/1942 monitor.
	Adjust the Text and Graphics sizes to your satisfaction.
    3.  Then for all the other display groups edit the Text and Graphics
	sizes using the arrow gadget to center the display.
    4.  When all the displays are centered with respect to the NTSC screen,
	select the Save gadget to save all the overscan values.
    5.	Reboot.  All the displays should then be centered, and you should
	not need to use the monitor controls again.


PAL and NTSC display modes do not display or use the arrow gadget.  To center
the screen in one of these modes, use the monitor controls.
