$Log:   interface.h,v $
 * Revision 1.7  94/03/31  16:10:33  jjszucs
 * o   Applying mirror manipulation to portrait-orientation images no longer
 *     causes inappropriate cropping.
 *
 * o   The Normalize glyph is now a 65x65 bitmap, like all other button glyphs.
 *     The glyph was 64x64 and strange lines when the glyph was displayed
 *     as a 65x65 mask was applied.
 *
 * o   The Zoom In and Zoom Out glyphs had black vertical line in the far
 *     right column. This has been eliminated.
 *
 * o   The interface panel is now made visible when the thumbnail state
 *     is initially entered at the start of a session.
 *
 * o   Changed fixed palette range from 16...240 to 0...255 for each
 *     color component (R/G/B). Although the clipped color component range
 *     was theoretically better for image quality, this change significantly
 *     reduces the complexity of the fixed palette code (which is called for
 *     all displayed pixels), increasing image display speed. The observed
 *     impact of the change on image quality is neglible.
 *
 * o   For NTSC systems, quick scaling was inadvertently being performed
 *     on the X-axis for portrait-orientation images. This increased
 *     the aspect ratio distortion, instead of decreasing the aspect
 *     ratio (as was the intent). This has been corrected, with significant
 *     code savings as a bonus.
 *
 * o   Center of zoom box now accurately corresponds to zoom cursor for
 *     all cases.
 *
 * o   Zoom center point is now at the center of the lenses of the magnifying
 *     glass image, not at the center of the entire image (which includes
 *     the handle).
 *
 * o   Zoom cursor bounds-checking is now correct for all cases.
 *
 * o   Zooming of portrait-orientation images now works correctly.
 *
 * o   Yet another attempt was made to implement a smooth scroll in the
 *     thumbnail display. However, due to the depth of the thumbnail screen
 *     (8 bitplanes), this results in a noticable "inchworm" effect. Since this
 *     is undesirable, jump scrolling continues to be used. This is being noted
 *     in this release note (and the associated RCS logs) primarily as a note
 *     to myself (and possibly others) once and for all that this is a
 *     Bad Idea(TM).
 *
 * o   Yet more changes to the "Easter Egg" text.

@Zoom manipulation implemented.

Fixed palette image display implemented with
DISPLAY_FIXED_PALETTE conditional compilation
option.

Pan X/Y offsets eliminated from image node
structure, no longer needed as pan is not
necessary.

All image manipulation features correctly mark
images as manipulated. Normalize button is
now correctly enabled/disabled depending on
state of image.

Control list cleared during all state transitions.
Prevents potential crashes due to inappropriate
controls remaining available.

Further changes to "Easter Egg" screen per davidj
