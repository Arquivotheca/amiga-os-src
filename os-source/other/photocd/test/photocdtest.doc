QUIET       Suppress progress reports
DISC        Obtain disc information
                (tests ObtainPhotoCDInfoA(...,PCD_Disc,...)
SESSION     Obtain session information
                (tests ObtainPhotoCDInfoA(...,PCD_Session,...)
BUFFER      Test buffer functions (AllocPCDImageBuffer(), FreePCDImageBuffer(),
                GetPCDResolution(), ...)
IMAGE       Obtain information on and read image
                (Tests ObtainPhotoCDInfo(...,PCD_Image,...) and
                 GetPCDImageDataA())
RESOLUTION  Resolution of image to read
            1 = Base/16 (192 x 128)
            2 = Base/4 (384 x 256)
            3 = Base (768 x 512)
            4 = 4Base (1536 x 1024)
            5 = 16Base (3072 x 2048)
RGB         Convert read YCC data to RGB
FILE        Write read image data to .QRT file. File is saved as
            IMGnnnn.QRT where nnnnn is the image number.
LINES       Read image in blocks of <n> lines. Default is to read entire
            image at once.
SCREEN      Open a high-resolution, interlaced, HAM8, maximum overscan
            screen while reading the image. This simulates the (very
            significant) impact of chip RAM contention caused by the
            display pane of the player being open while an image is being
            read.
