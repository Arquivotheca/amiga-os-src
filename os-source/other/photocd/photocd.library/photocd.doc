   NAME
       GetPCDImageData()   -   load and decode Photo CD image data

   SYNOPSIS
       BOOL GetPCDImageData(void *pcdHandle, UBYTE *imageBuffer,
           Tag firstTag,...);
       success=GetPCDImageData(pcdHandle, buffer, firstTag,...);

           struct TagItem *tags);
       success=GetPCDImageDataA(pcdHandle, imageBuffer, tags);

   FUNCTION
       Load and decode data from an image on a Photo CD disc or from
       a file.

   INPUTS
       pcdHandle   -   Photo CD handle returned by OpenPhotoCD();
                       this may be NULL if the PCD_File tag is used
                       to specify a Photo CD image file

       imageBuffer -   Pointer to buffer for loaded image data.
                       This buffer must be sufficently large
                       to hold 24 bits (3 bytes) per retrieved image
                       pixel. The buffer size may be computed using
                       PCDImageBufferSize() macro or the buffer may
                       be allocated using AllocPCDImageBuffer(),
                       which automatically computes the buffer size.

       tags        -   Tag array containing additional parameters.

   INPUT TAGS
       All tags are optional, unless otherwise indicated.

       PCD_ErrorCode       (ULONG *) Pointer to ULONG where error code
                           (one of PHOTOCD_ERR_*) is deposited if this
                           function fails. This variable is unchanged
                           if the operation is successful.

       PCD_File            (BPTR) dos.library file handle to a Photo CD
                           image file (normally with a .PCD extension)
                           from which the image is to be loaded. Either
                           this tag or the PCD_Image tag must be specified
                           to indicate the image that is to be loaded.

       PCD_Image           (UWORD) Cardinal image number of image to load
                           from Photo CD source on which the handle has been
                           opened. If this tag is specified, the pcdHandle
                           argument must be a Photo CD handle returned
                           by OpenPhotoCD(). Either this tag or
                           PCD_File must be specified to indicate the
                           image that is to be loaded.

       PCD_Overview        (BOOL) If the value of this tag is TRUE,
                           the image is loaded from the Overview Pack.
                           The Overview Pack contains Base/16 (192 x 128)
                           versions of all images on the disc in a single,
                           contiguous block, allowing high-speed loading
                           of these low-resolution images. In this case,
                           the image must be specified with PCD_Image
                           (PCD_File may not be used) and PCD_Resolution
                           must be PHOTOCD_RES_BASE16 (which is the
                           default for this tag if PCD_Overview is TRUE).

       PCD_Resolution      (UBYTE) Resolution of image data to be loaded.
                           One of PHOTOCD_RES_*. The default for this tag
                           is PHOTOCD_RES_BASE (768 x 512), unless PCD_Overvi
ew
                           is TRUE, in which case PHOTOCD_RES_BASE16
                           (192 x 128) is the default (and only valid
                           resolution).

       PCD_Format          (UBYTE) Format to use for loaded image data.
                           One of PHOTOCD_FORMAT_*. The default for this tag
                           is PHOTOCD_FORMAT_YUV.

       PCD_StartLine       (UWORD) Ordinal number of the first image line
                           to be loaded. The default value for this tag
                           is the first line of the image.

       PCD_EndLine         (UWORD) Ordinal number of the last image line
                           to be loaded. The default value of this tag
                           is the last line of the image.

       PCD_GammaCorrect    (BOOL) TRUE to gamma-correct RGB values; FALSE
                           to return uncorrected RGB values. This tag is
                           only useful if PCD_Format is PHOTOCD_FORMAT_RGB.

       PCD_LineCall        (struct Hook *) Hook to call while loading lines.
                           This hook for every <n> lines, as defined by
                           PCD_LineCallIntvl (or defaulting to 1).

                           This function is called with the standard
                           hook call conventions, with the following
                           parameters:

                               hook (A0)   -   Hook structure passed as
                                               PCD_LineCall tag value
                               object (A2) -   NULL
                               message (A1)-   (ULONG *) pointer to line
                                               number of line for which
                                               hook is being called.

       PCD_LineCallIntvl   (UWORD) Interval between calls to PCD_LineCall
                           callback hook. This tag is only applicable with
                           PCD_LineCall. The default is 1.

   RESULT
       success     -   TRUE if success; FALSE if failure

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES

       To obtain the best possible performance from this function:

       o   The number of lines read in each call should be a multiple of 2.

       o   The starting line number (specified with PCD_StartLine and
           defaulting to 0) of each call should be a multiple of 2.

       o   Image data should be read in sequential order (i.e., beginning wit
h
           line 0 of the image and advancing (preferably by a multiple of 2 l
ines)
           toward the last line of the image).

       By following these guidelines, the caller allows the function to:

       o   Utilize cached image data to interpolate chrominance channel 1 (U)
           and channel 2 (V) data, which is only present for every other pixe
l
           in Photo CD images.

       o   Utilize the pre-fetching features of CDFileSystem. Note that
           CDFileSystem will disable pre-fetching for the life of a file
           handle if any reverse seeks occur. Reading image lines in
           non-sequential order will cause reverse seeks, and the
           resulting disabling of prefetching in CDFileSystem, to occur.

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
       The GetPCDPixel*() functions are implemented as a set of macros
       that access a resolution table in PhotoCDBase.

       The GetPCDPixel*() functions are array-oriented, causing the
       compiler to generate multiplication instructions, and should
       not be used in time-critical code. For such situations, a
       pointer-based method should be used.

   FUNCTION
       Open Photo CD handle. This handle is passed to other photocd.library
       functions (such as ObtainPhotoCDInfo()) that need to access the
       Photo CD filesystem structure.

   INPUTS
       tags            -   tag array containing additional parameters

   INPUT TAGS
       All tags are optional unless otherwise indicated.

       PCD_ErrorCode       (ULONG *) Pointer to ULONG where error code
                           (one of PHOTOCD_ERR_*) is deposited if this

                           if the operation is successful.

       PCD_Source          (STRPTR) Path to Photo CD filesystem structure.
                           As an example, if the Photo CD filesystem
                           structure is in the directory PhotoCD/Disc2
                           of DOS device HD1:, the value for this tag
                           is "HD1:PhotoCD/Disc2." The default is
                           "CD0:", which is the first CD-ROM drive device.

   RESULT
       pcdHandle       -   Photo CD handle; NULL if failure

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
       The caller must be a process (not a task) for this and related
       functions, which are dependent on dos.library calls, to operate
       correctly.

       The Photo CD handle returned is private to photocd.library. Do
       not examine or modify it.

   RESULT
       offset          -   offset into buffer for pixel triplet

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
       PCDImagePixelOffset() is implemented as a macro defined in
       libraries/photocd.h and libraries/photocd.i.

       This macro is array-oriented, causing the compiler to generate
       multiplication instructions, and should not be used in time-
       critical code. For such situations, a pointer-based method
       should be used.
