68060 Software Package Errata		As of: March 1994
------------------------------

Known errata for this release, (Beta - B1):

(1) 

Scenario:
---------
If {i,d}mem_{read,write}_{byte,word,long}() returns
a failing value to the 68060SP, the package ignores
this return value and continues with program execution
as if it never received a failing value.

Effect:
-------
For example, if a user executed "fsin.x ADDR,fp0" where
ADDR should cause a "segmentation violation", the memory read
requested by the package should return a failing value
to the package. Since the package currently ignores this 
return value, the user program will continue to the
next instruction, and the result created in fp0 will be
undefined.
