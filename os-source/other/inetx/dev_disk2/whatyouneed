In order to use this new stuff, you will need :

1. inet.library version 5.0 or later in your inet:libs directory
2. socket.library version 4.0 or greater iin your inet:libs directory
3. The inet:serv binaries on this disk placed in your inet:serv directory.
4. A file called 'sana2_devs' in your inet:s directory (see the readme file.)
5. a directory  in your system's 'devs:' volume called 'networks'.
5. any SANA-2 drivers for your specific hardware located in 'devs:networks'.
6. to modify inet:s/start-inet to replace any board references that are
   'ae0' and the like to 's0'. Example from the standard start-inet:
   
  [ ... ]

 ; Configure first ethernet controller.  This will fail if the board is 
 ; missing.

 inet:c/ifconfig >nil: s0 $hostname netmask 255.255.255.0 -trailers
 ;                     ^^
 ; inet:c/ifconfig >nil: ae0 $hostname netmask 255.255.255.0 -trailers -OLD-
 ;                       ^^^\_old
 if warn 
    echo "Internet boot fail: could not configure first ethernet controller"
    echo "Is the controller installed properly?"
    quit 20
