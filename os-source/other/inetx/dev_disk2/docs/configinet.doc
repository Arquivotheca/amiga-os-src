-----------------------------

This is a new utility that is currently used to set/unset the gateways
flag within inet.library (version 5.0 or later.)  

The current options are

	-G=GATEWAY/K,-Q=QUERY/K:

The -G=GATEWAY flag requires an argument. That argument must be a '0'
(zero) for "off" and anything else ('1', 'mommy', etc) for 'on'.

The -Q=QUERY flag requires an argument.  The argument to this flag will
be one of the other available flags. In this version (1.0) the only
option is 'G' for "gateway". So saying 

	configinet -Q=G

will return you the current state of gateways flag in inet.library. The
output will be as an ascii '0' or '1'. Rediection of this output will
cause suppression of the trailing line feed, facilitating using this as
a way to set environment variables. ("configinet >env:gateway_state -q=g")

The only folks who even need to use this are those who use their Amiga
as a gateway between other systems. The 5.0 inet.library defaults this
flag to 'off' (older iinet.library revs defaulted to -on-.)
