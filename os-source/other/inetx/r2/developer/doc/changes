AS225 R2 -  Beta 2 changes & additions
--------------------------------------

Inet.library 5.2  (61660 bytes)-

    - Fixed a low-memory problem that could cause enforcer hits.

    - Made a change in the way inet sets SANA-II ethernet
      addresses.  The way it -was- being done was keeping
      Interworks' DECNET package from working with AS225.
      (DECNET likes to set the ethernet addresses to "special"
       addresses.  AS225 doesn't care.  So that DECNET is
       happy, it has to be started before AS225 sets the address.)

    - Added a one-line change to the TCP timeout mechanism.
      Helps out high-loss network connections; without this fix, 
      the TCP timeouts keep getting bigger and bigger -- even when 
      not necessary.


 ------------------------

Socket.library 4.2 - 

    - Domain Name Service (DNS) added. See the file 'doc/dns.doc'.


 ------------------------

Rshd 1.6 -

    - This version should fix the problem where the old one would 
      hang if you amount of returned data exceeded the buffer size of
      the pipe: device.
      
    - It is probably a good idea to change the pipe: entry in your
      "devs:mountlist" file to something like :
      
         PIPE:      
             Handler = L:Queue-Handler
             Stacksize = 10000
             Priority = 5
             GlobVec = -1
             Blocksize = 16384
             Buffers = 0
             surfaces = 1
             BlocksPerTrack = 1
             LowCyl = 0
             HighCyl = 1
             Device = " "
             Unit = 0
         #
       
      Note the space in the 'device' entry.


 ------------------------

Ftp (2.0) & ftpd (2.1)

    These have both been rewritten from scratch.


 ------------------------

configinet 1.0

    This is a new executable (in "inet:c") that allows you to set/unset
    the (new) gateways flag within iinet.library. This is only of interest
    to you if you use any of your machines as a gateway. See the doc file
    "configinet.doc" for more info.

 ------------------------

nfsd  3.3

    This is the new NFS file server.  This allows your Amiga to act as a 
    file server.  See the doc file "nfsd.doc" for more information.

 ------------------------


config 37.9

    This is now more in line with the Amiga Style Guide.  It will no
    longer accept zero arguments.  You must ask it for what you want.
    ReadArgs support is in this now. That means that new keywords are
    available:

    -R=RECONFIG/S,-U=USER/S,-H=HOSTNAME/S,-M=RECONFIG/S,-V=VALUE/K: 

    The old flags are still supported but you can now use the new key
    words as well.
