    This is a BETA version of this software. ALL the files on this disk 
    should be considered beta and, as such, we may change them at will
    (theoretically because of the input from beta testers :))
 
    ******************************************************************

This is a beta release of the CBM AS225 TCP/IP package.  There are some
important changes to this software that must be dealt with so please read
and understand the following: 

                            -------------
                            General stuff
                            -------------

    1. You need inet.library version 5.2 or later in your inet:libs
       directory.
    
    2. You need socket.library version 4.0 or later in your inet:libs
       directory.
    

    3. You need a directory called 'networks' in your DEVS: directory.
       devs:networks"

    4. This software now uses the SANA-II device drivers. You will need 
       to place the SANA-II device drivers in the "devs:networks" 
       directory. Commodore provides SANA-II device drivers for the 
       A2065 Ethernet card, the A2060 ARCNET card, and drivers for SLIP 
       and CSLIP. Any other hardware used must have it's own SANA-II 
       device driver. This would normally come from the hardware's 
       manufacturer.

       These network device drivers should be placed in the 
       "DEVS:networks" directory.

    5. You need a file in your "inet:s:" directory called "sana2_devs".
       See the section below on the "sana2_devs" file for what this needs
       to look like.
    
    6. The "inet:db/inetd.conf" has changed in structure.   The 'user'
       field in the previous version has been removed. So, if an entry in
       your old inetd.conf file lookked like:
       
            ftp stream tcp nowait nobody inet:serv/ftpd -l
       
       then the new version would look like:
       
            ftp stream tcp nowait inet:serv/ftpd -l
       
       You are warned - the new inetd will not work properly with the
       old inetd.conf structure.
       

Inet.library 5.2  (61660 bytes)
-------------------------------

    
    There are two main things to note about inet.library v5.2 :

    1. It is now a SANA-II library in that you need SANA-II drivers to 
       talk to your hardware.  You will need the a2065.device (Ethernet) 
       and/or the a2060.device(ARCNET) to speak to the Commodore boards.
       These drivers are on this disk in a directory called 
       ":devs/networks". The proper place for these drivers is in a 
       directory called "networks" in your system's "devs:" volume.
        
        example:   "devs:networks/a2065.device"

       In addition, you need a file 'sana2_devs' which goes in the
       inet:s directory.  This is described in detail below.

    2. This new inet.library does NOT forward IP packets from board to
       board. The old inet.library did this. It shouldn't have. (See 
       RFC 1122.)  The old version (a) defaulted to ON, and (b) had 
       no way to turn it off.  The new one defaults to OFF and we now 
       provide you with a "inet:c/configinet" which allows you to 
       (a) set the status of  this flag and (b) query the status of 
       the flag.
       
       People using Amigas as gateways should take note.  Docs for 
       'configinet' are in the docs directory.


Socket.library 4.2 (25432 bytes)
--------------------------------

    The new version 4.2 of the new socket.library offers Domain Name
    Service (DNS).  See the docs directory.



     ==================================================================

Sana2_devs file
---------------

        Inet.library has received some major changes in terms of
    it's communication with networking hardware.  As of version 5.0,
    all of the hardcoded device drivers (such as hardcoded A2065,
    A2060, or SLIP drivers) have been removed from the code, and
    replaced with an interface to standardized SANA-II drivers. 
    Naturally, this causes certain changes to AS225 installations:
    
        Most importantly, there exists a new file "inet:s/sana2_devs"
    which must exist in order for inet.library to operate.  A sample
    of the file follows:
    
    #Sana II devices used by the inet.library
    #device path             Unit No IPType  ARPType (opt. hardware addr)
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------
    devs:Networks/a2065.device  0     2048    2054
    devs:Networks/a2065.device  1     2048    2054
    devs:Networks/a2060.device  0     240     241
    devs:Networks/slip.device   0     1       2
    
        Each line in the file represents an inet.library device, and
    these devices are numbered, beginning with the first entry in
    the file.  The name that inet.library will know the device by is
    simply an 's', followed by the number of the entry in the file -
    starting with zero.  In our example, the first line relates
    to 's0', the second to 's1', the third to 's2', and the last to
    's3'.
    
        Since the hardcoded drivers are no longer included in
    inet.library, any and all references users may be making to them
    (such as references to 'ae0' or 'ae1' in their inet:s/start-inet
    files) are now faulty.
    
        Each line is broken up into five fields -- the pathname of
    the SANA-II device, the unit number to configure, the ip and arp
    packet types, and an optional hardware address.
    
        The path of the SANA-II device is fairly self-explanatory. 
    Most SANA-II devices can (should) be found in devs:Networks.
    
        The unit number is used to differentiate between multiple
    boards of the same type in a machine.  For instance, if you plug
    two A2065 boards into an Amiga, the first board is unit 0, the
    second is unit 1, and so on.
    
        The IP and ARP types are standardized "packet types".  It is
    by these numbers that inet.library is capable of determining
    which packets coming over the network are TCP/IP packets. 
    Unfortunately, even though these numbers are standardized, they
    vary between different types of hardware. For Ethernet, they are
    2048 and 2054, respectively.  Arcnet seems to have three
    seperate 'standards', but the most common usage seems to be 240
    and 241 respectively.  SLIP, as in our example above, has no
    notion of packet types, so any two different numbers will do.
    
        If you wish to use inet.library with an unusual SANA-II
    device that doesn't have an inherent hardware address, you can
    optionally specify one.  The format is a 0x, followed by any
    number of hex digits (up to the SANA-II limit of 32).  An
    example might be 0x8 for hardware address 8.
