  

  The NFSD file server is also an arexx function host. This provides an
  ARexx port that is used to control and configure the server.

  In order to run the nfsd file server daemon, you will need to:

  1. Have nfsd in your inet:serv directory.
  2. Have the executable "netrexx" in your inet:c directory.
  3. Have the rexx script "startnfsd.rexx" in your rexx: directory.
  4. Edit the user settings in the file "rexx:startnfsd.rexx" to suit
     the needs of the machine the server is on and the desires off the
     sysadmin. (see #6)
  5. remove the line in inet:s/start-inet that runs 'portmapd' as the
     nfsd will deal with that for you (portmapd is pretty pointless
     anyway. You should probably toss it out.) The nfsd executable WILL
     NOT RUN with the other portmapd running!
  6. Read the entire "rexx:startnfsd.rexx" file!! There is useful info
     in this.
  7. Have the line "run <nil: >nil: rx startnfsd.rexx" in your 
     'inet:s/start-inet' file.  You can also execute this from the
     command line but failure to redirect to nil: will hang that shell.
