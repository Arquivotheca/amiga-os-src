	-----------------------------------------------------------
   
	** NOTE: Users of versions previous to 37.4 will need to change
	         their termcap or terminfo!!!
   
	Usage:
   
	HOST/A,-L=USER/K,-C=SCREEN/S,-X=LEFT/K,-Y=TOP/K,-W=WIDTH/K,
	-H=HEIGHT/K,-T=TERM/K,-U=UNIT/K,-R=NORESIZE/S
       
	The options :
       
		HOST:   The name of the host machine with which to 
			connect.

		USER:	The user's login name on the remote machine. The
			default is the entry given by "user=" in the
			"inet:s/inet.config" file.

		SCREEN: Requests the use of a custom screen. The default
			action is to open rlogin on in a window on the
			Workbench screen.

		LEFT:	The position of the left edge of the rlogin window
			(measured in pixels) on the Workbench screen.
			Diregarded if the "SCREEN" option is specified.

		TOP:	The position of the top edge of the rlogin window
			(measured in pixels) on the Workbench screen.
			Diregarded if the "SCREEN" option is specified.

		WIDTH:  The width of the rlogin window (measured in
			pixels) on the Workbench screen.  See note below.

		HEIGHT: The height of the rlogin window (measured in
			pixels) on the Workbench screen.  See note below.

		TERM:   This is the termtype used by the rlogin session.
			The default is "rlamiga"
      where:  -l user  login name on the remote machine.  The default is
                       the entry given by "user=" in inet:s/inet.config
                
              -x #     left edge of the window
              -y #     top edge of the window
              -h #     height of the window
              -w #     width of the window
              -r 0     no resize gadget
              -c       gives a custom screen (and NO windows)
              -t t/b   changes default terminal type and baud rate
              -u #     toggle use of the 2.0 console device options
   
   
              NOTE: All options and their arguments MUST be separated 
              by at least one space
   
              legal:    rlogin -x 400 -y 200 -u 1
   
              illegal:  rlogin -x400 - y 200 -u1
                                ^^^           ^^^
   
   
   --------
   
   
   Resizing:       -r
   
   Use an argument of '0' (zero) to turn OFF the resize gadget.
   Any other numeric argument turns it on.  No argument is an error.
   
   USAGE:          -r  <#>
   
   EXAMPLE:        -r  0 
   
   DEFAULT:        On
   
   --------
   
   Console:        -u
   
   Note: The -u option is functional only under the 2.x Operating System.
   
   Under the 2.0 operating system the console device has the options to
   have a character mapped display and cut-and-paste between console
   windows. If you run rlogin under the 2.x operating system you will get
   these options be default. If you desire, you can alter the default by
   use of the -u flag ('u' for 'unit'.)
   
   Under 2.0 you have the options of '0', '1' and '3'. Zero ('0') gives
   you the same behavior as the console device under 1.3.  Unit number one
   ('1') gives you a character mapped display. This means that if you
   resize the window, the text will be redrawn to match the new window
   dimensions.  The use of option '3' gives you the character mapped
   display as well as the ability to do cut-and-paste operations between
   console windows (the Amiga's CLI for example.) The default under 2.0 is
   '3'. See the AmigaDOS 2.0 manuals for more information on these
   features.
   
   A side benefit of this option is that it allows you to resize the rlogin
   window down to a very small size. Such resizing is NOT available under
   earlier ( < 2.0 ) operating systems or if you don't set the -u flag to
   either '1' or '3'. The default is option 3 which gives you both character
   mapping and cut & paste.
   
   Under the 1.3 operating system you have only '0' (the default)
   
   USAGE:          -u <option>
           
   EXAMPLE:        -u 0
                   -u 1
   
   DEFAULT:         Under OS 2.0 the default is   '-u 3'
                    Under OS 1.3 the default is   '-u 0'
   
   --------
   
   TermType:       -t
   
   The termtype flag ( '-t' ) allows the user to tell the host what what
   his terminal type is. This is handy for using different termcap or
   terminfo files. There is a direct relationship between what Rlogin
   passes as it's termtype and which termcap or terminfo the host will use
   for you.
   
   The termtype also passes a requested baud rate for your session.  The
   host may or may not honor this, however.
   
   The default for Rlogin (what it will tell the host if you don't use the
   -t flag) is:
   
           RLamiga/9600
   
   The termcap that accompanies this release has it's identifiers matching
   the default termtype of Rlogin.
   
   The included termcap file can be converted to a terminfo entry for use
   with applications that use terminfo, as is common on System V Unix
   machines.  The System V "captoinfo" and "tic" commands can be used to
   convert termcap files into terminfo form.  The file terminfo.src is
   included for those who do not have the captoinfo command.  See the
   captoinfo and tic man pages.
   
   
   
   USAGE:          -t <termtype/baud>
   
   EXAMPLE:        -t myterm/9600
   
   DEFAULT:        -t RLamiga/9600
   
   
   --------
   
   
   LeftEdge:       -x
   
   
   This flag allows you to specify the horizontal position of the left
   edge of the window (if you are using a window and not a screen.)
   
   USAGE:          -x <position>
   
   EXAMPLE:        -x 100
   
   DEFAULT:        -x 0 (zero)
   
   
   --------
   
   
   TopEdge:        -y
   
   
   This flag allows you to specify the vertical position of the top edge
   of the window (if you are using a window and not a screen.)
   
   USAGE:          -y <position>
   
   EXAMPLE:        -y 100
   
   DEFAULT:        -y 0 (zero)
   
   
   --------
   
   
   Width:  -w
   
   
   This flag allows you to specify the width of the window. (if you are
   using a window and not a screen.)
   
   USAGE:          -w <width>
   
   EXAMPLE:        -w 700
   
   DEFAULT:  If you open RLogin in a window, it will attempt to open the
             window to a width that will give you a full 80 columns of
             text.  This value is calculated from the current text that
             you are using. If the width value that it calculates turns
             out to be larger than the width of the screen, the window
             will open to the screen's width.
  
             If you open rlogin on a custom screen the default action
             (under 2.0) is to open the display to the maximum height
             described by the Overscan Preferences editor (v37.4 rlogin.)
             This default action can be overridden with the -w and -h
             flags.  
                     Minimum size = 80 cols x 25 rows.
                     Maximum size = max screen size
   
   --------
   
   
   Height:         -h
   
   
   This flag allows you to specify the height of the window. (if you are
   using a window and not a screen.)
   
   USAGE:          -h <height>
   
   EXAMPLE:        -h 500
   
   DEFAULT:  If you open RLogin in a window, it will attempt to open the
             window to a height that will give you a full 24 lines of
             text. This value is calculated from the current text that you
             are using. If the height value that it calculates turns out
             to be larger than the height of the screen, the window will
             open to the screen's height.
           
             If you open rlogin on a custom screen the default action
             (under 2.0) is to open the display to the maximum height
             described by the Overscan Preferences editor (v37.4 rlogin.)
             This default action can be overridden with the -w and -h
             flags.  
                     Minimum size = 80 cols x 25 rows.
                     Maximum size = max screen size
   
   --------
   
   Screen:         -c
   
   This flag tells Rlogin to open as an Amiga custom screen instead of as
   a window on the Amiga Workbench. This flag overrides any and all
   position and size flags.
   
   Under 2.0 it is possible to open a custom screen that extends beyond
   the visible area on the monitor. The default action for rlogin (on a
   custom screen) is to use the settings that you have set with your
   OverScan Preferences editor. This prevents you from having the text
   scroll right off the bottom of the display. This can be overridden
   with the -w flag and/or -h flag(s)
   
   USAGE:          -c
   
   DEFAULT:        Off
