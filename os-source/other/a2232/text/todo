;------------------------

Check that both hardware and Xon/Xoff handshake can be supported at the
same time.  Think about handshake to the modem at a higher speed,
yet still retaining end-to-end handshake.



;------------------------ QA items

check for memory leaks

grep prefixes for proper size and/or base register

DTR not dropped on CloseDevice()



;------------------------ Blue sky

Cause 6502 to keep track of read bytes requested... don't bother me until
satisfied.

Save an index register; make all buffer offset relative to the buffer's
controlarea.

Move Interrupt structure from unit to device base (save memory).

Convert over to SoftInts()

Handle ^Q writes (should Xon self???).

Note that the 75 baud/1200 baud trick is done by repeating the output
bits 16 times in a row...
