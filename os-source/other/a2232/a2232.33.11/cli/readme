This file describes the use of the new port-handler, aux-handler, and Mount
provided on this disk.	These are required for use of your multiple serial
card from the CLI or AmigaBasic.

The port-handler handles normal buffered communication.  The aux-handler
allows for remove NEWCLI.  Aux-handler is unbuffered.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mount command supports the additional keywords BAUD and CONTROL, and
the special startup string environment.

BAUD is one of the rates supported by the A2232.  Valid values are:
110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 115200

CONTROL is a string consisting of the number of bits in the word, the
parity, and the number of stop bits.  Valid values for control are:

	1st character	Number of Bits
			7, 8
	2nd character	PARITY
			E even)
			O (odd)
			N (none)
			M (mark
			S (space)
	3rd character	Number of Stop Bits
			1, 2

Note that the value for CONTROL keyword must be in double quotes.  ("   ").

The DEVICE and UNIT are specified normally.



An entry in your devs:Mountlist file would look like this:

#
SER2:	device = serial.device
	EHandler = l:port-handler
	unit = 2
	Stacksize = 6000
	baud = 9600
	control = "8N1"
#
AUX2:	device = serial.device
	EHandler = l:aux-handler
	unit = 2
	Stacksize = 6000
	baud = 9600
	control = "8N1"
#


Once mounted, these entries establish defaults.  The defaults can be
overridden on the command line, after the name is specified, in the order
of BAUD RATE, CONTROL STRING, and for aux-handler only, optional RAW. The
parameters are seperated by / characters.

newshell aux2:9600/8E1

will open a remote Shell using aux2: at 9600 baud, with even parity.


The RAW option only applies to the aux-handler.  This is the same as
opening the RAW: console.
