Thanks, there is a bug in the 1.3 version of the A2232 software that it
can generate INT2's before the INT2 handler is setup. (ie noise on the
lines, modems that echo "OK" when they power up.) I'll copy over the
serial.device that comes on the A2232 disk to my 2.0 system and let
you know if it still breaks. :-)

Check close... looks like the 60000 will need to wait.

Does anyone know how to get the A2232 to drop DTR?  Unlike the standard serial
port, the A2232 serial ports do not drop DTR when the device is closed.  The
serial device I'm using is from the A2232 installation disk, and is dated
23-May-90.  Has Commodore fixed it, either in software or hardware?  Have they
come out with a 2.0 version of the A2232 preferences?  I tried calling
Commodore customer service, but they blew me off because I hadn't gone through
my dealer.  I checked with my dealer, but his track record of getting answers
from Commodore is that it is slow, and takes a lot of prodding.
