Request for Assignment of a SANA-II Hardware Type
Amiga Networking Group

The Amiga SANA-II Data Link standard interface utilizes specialized
identification numbers called "Hardware Types", that uniquely describe
the method of networking for individual pieces of Amiga networking hardware.



Not every piece of Amiga networking hardware needs to be given a specific
hardware type.  For instance, if company XYZ created a new ARCNET board for
the Amiga, they wouldn't need to request a new hardware type -- one already
exists for ARCNET, and all ARCNET drivers should identify themselves as such.
The same methodology applies for all Ethernet boards, all LocalTalk boards,
etc.  The drivers that do need a specific hardware type assigned are those
where the operation is entirely proprietary, and not merely a different
implementation of a standard networking protocol.  Please note that these
numbers reflect the hardware method used to communicate -- not the individual
implementation method.  As an example, a Zorro II Ethernet board,
a Zorro III Ethernet board, a PCMCIA Ethernet board, and a parallel-port
Ethernet adapter should all contain the hardware type S2WireType_Ethernet.

The following hardware types are currently assigned (from the include file
"sana2.h"):

Please fill in the following form, and return it to your Commodore
representitive.

Request for Networking Hardware Type:

Company Name:

Short Product Description:

If applicable, manufacturer/product numbers:

        Manufacturer Number:

        Product Number:

If the above was not applicable, describe how the product connects to the
Amiga:

Hardware Network Addresses:

        If applicable, length (in bits) of hardware network
        address:

        If applicable, is the hardware address programmable?
           (Can it, or must it be set by software?)

        If applicable, are the network addresses guaranteed to be entirely
        unique?

Is the interface operation defined in a publicly available
standard?

If not, please include a short description of operation.  (This is not
a requirement, but is strongly advised.)
