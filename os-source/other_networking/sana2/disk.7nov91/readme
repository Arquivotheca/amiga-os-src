This distribution contains the SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification,
version of November 7, 1991, for final comment and approval.  This means
that no additional changes are expected and that only compelling objections
will keep this version of the spec from becoming final on January 1, 1991.

This distribution also contains supporting materials in the form of some
example code.  More example code, including a skeleton SANA-II device
driver, are planned for the near future.

Finally, so that you can actually use this now to develop network protocols,
a beta binary of our A2065 ethernet driver is included.
