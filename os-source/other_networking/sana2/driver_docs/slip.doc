SLIP & CSLIP SANA-II device drivers
-----------------------------------

Note:

The slip and cslip drivers work exactly the same way.  All you have to do
is substitute the word "slip" for "cslip" in this file (and in your
applications) to make it all work :)

 ----

Place the file named 'cslip.device' in DEVS:Networks. Next, copy the
cslip0.config file to ENVARC:Sana2/cslip0.config.  If you are planning on
using multiple CSLIP units, you will need a separate configuration file for
each unit. The file's are named cslip[unit number].config.  So, CSLIP unit
5 would have a configuration file named cslip5.config.  Currently, there is
a limitation of eight CSLIP units, 0-7.  Please see the included
cslip0.config file for an explanation of how the file should be set up.

If you are using the cslip.device with AS225, you will need to add a new
entry to your inet:s/sana2_devs file.  IP Type and ARP type may be set
to anything you wish. (Footnote 1)

If you are using the cslip.device with Envoy, you will need to use the
NIPC Configuration Editor to add cslip.device to nipc's list of devices.
Select 'Use defaults' for IP Type and ARP Type.

Usage
-----

If you are using the cslip.device to connect to a dedicated line, you should
leave out the 'CD' option in the configuration file.  You should set the
baud rate to that used by the other end of the line.

If you are using the cslip.device to connect to a dial-up slip connection,
you will need to configure your modem to ignore the DTR signal from your
Amiga.  Next, you will need to use a terminal program to dial the cslip
line.  Once you have connected, quit the terminal program.  Then, use
the 'online' CLI command to tell the cslip.device to attach itself to the
serial port.  The command line should look something like:

1.> online cslip.device 0

Where 0 is the cslip.device unit number.  Unfortunately there isn't an
easy way to get cslip.device to hang up the phone.  The easiest way is
to just turn your modem off, which should cause carrier to drop and cause
cslip.device to go offline.

You may also tell cslip.device to go offline by using the 'offline' command.
(Both online and offline use ReadArgs(), so specifiying a '?' argument
will give you their usage strings.)

Advanced Usage
--------------

For those of you who would like to use the cslip.device as a server for
a dialup line, you'll have to wait a bit until I fix up my "phoned" program.
It's not currently in a usable state.


Version 37.3 Release Notes for both drivers
-------------------------------------------

Both cslip.device and slip.device put up an EasyRequest() if something
goes wrong at OpenDevice() time with either the config file or if the
serial.device you wanted to use couldn't be opened.

The slip driver now supports all of the options available with the
cslip driver.  Somehow the last release of slip.device had the wrong
version of slip.device.  Sorry about that.

Both drivers support comments in the config files. :)



Footnote 1:

Actually, if you want to use the packet tracking functions of SANA-II with
cslip.device, you will have to specify a packet type of 2048 to track
IP packets, which also happen to be the only types of packets cslip deals
with.
