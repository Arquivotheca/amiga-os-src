@Official Additions and Clarifications To Standard.txt

These addenda will be incorporated into any future version of the specification
and should must be followed at this time.

---

Though it is not in standard.txt, you should note for all devices that
promiscuous mode requires exclusive opening of the device.

---

The standard system location for SANA-II network device drivers is in a
directory called 'sana2' which exists in the "DEVS:" directory.  Example:

      devs:sana2/a2065.device

This is the official location for these drivers. It may be necessary for your
install programs/scripts to create this directory.
