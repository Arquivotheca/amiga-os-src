#define S2WireType_Ethernet             1

ios2_DataLength:
	valid ethernet packets have 64 to 1500 bytes of data.

Address format:
	Ethernet addresses consist of 47 bits of address information and
	a 1 bit multicast flag. The standard for expressing ethernet
	addresses is as 6 bytes (octets) in the order in which the bytes
	are transmitted with the low-order bits in a byte transmitted
	first. The multicast flag bit is the least-significant bit of the
	first byte.

	Ethernet addresses in a Sana2IOReq occupy the first 6 bytes of
	an address field in transmission order with the low-order bits in
	a byte transmitted first.

Station Address:
	The Ethernet standard allows logical and global hardware addresses.
	One bit in the address field indicates whether the address is global
	or local.  If it is global, it must be an address assigned by the
	hardware manufacturer from a pool allocated by Xerox.  The address will
	be unique to that device from among all Ethernet devices ever produced.
	This is the usual form of addressing used by most protocols over
	Ethernet.
	
	Some protocols use logical hardware adresses, which allows the software
	protocol to change the hardware address.  Software protocols which use
	logical adresses may have problems co-existing on the same device with
	other protocols.
	
	Drivers may override any attempt to set the address to any non-logical
	address other than the ROM address.

Raw reads and writes:
	6 bytes of destination address,
	6 bytes of source address,
	2 bytes of type,
	64 to 1500 bytes of data
	(followed by 4 byte CRC value covering all of the above
	 which is hardware generated and checked, hence not included
	 in even raw packets)

Multicast:	Supported

Broadcast:	Supported

Promiscuous:	Supported

	Each ethernet board must have a unique ethernet hardware address.
	Drivers will override any attempt to set the address to anything
	other than the ROM address.
