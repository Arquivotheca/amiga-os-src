@Changes

There have been few substantive changes from the Novemeber 7 Draft for Final
Comment and approval.  Ethernet.txt "Station Address" has been changed. There
have also been minor clarifications and typographical corrections and a section
was added to clarify ARCNET framing.  An addenda.txt has been added for minor
changes and corrections to the main standard.txt made since it's release as Rev
1.0, 23-Apr-92.  These changes will be incorporated into any future versions of
standard.txt.

The A2065.device had a few bugs fixed:
	- The station address can now be set to other than the ROM address to
allow the use of logical rather than global hardware addresses (see
ethernet.txt).
	- Promiscous mode no longer filters out multicasts.
	- A device opened in exclusive mode then closed can now be opened again.

Since the Fish Disk/'91 DevCon draft of the SANA-II standard, here is a
summary list of the important changes:

	- Packet type specification has been drastically simplified.  The
original standard called for a generalized "Packet Magic" which all drivers and
protocols had to deal with, even though few people should ever have to worry
about the problem.  We could also have specified that there are 802.3 SANA-II
drivers and that there are ethernet drivers and that if you want 802.3 and
ethernet (even if on the same wire) from the same machine, use two ethernet
boards.  This didn't make sense because we don't anticipate multiple protocols
needing to use 802.3 frames nor much encouragement for hardware manufactures to
provide special 802.3 drivers.  The current solution keeps the standard simple
and allows highly efficient implementations, but it does make ethernet drivers
a little more complex and does make using 802.3 frames harder.
	- The original SANA-II device driver specification called for drivers
to have no internal buffers and to get all buffers from protocols in the form
of a data structure called a NetBuff. Hence, all protocols were required to use
NetBuffs. This was highly unsatisfactory since most protocols are implemented
from an existing code base which includes its own buffer management scheme. 
NetBuffs are removed from the standard and replaced with a function callback.
	- The original standard called for an interface to the ability of some
hardware to simultaneously accept packets for several hardware addresses.  Such
a feature is of dubious usefulness.  In order to simplify the standard, station
aliases are no longer part of the SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification.
If station aliasing does turn out to be a useful feature available on some
hardware for the Amiga, the standard can easily be extended to re-introduce
station aliasing.  Remember that all Exec drivers must check for io_Command
values not supported by the driver. Hence, SANA-II commands can be added
without requiring that existing drivers be rev'd.
	- Since the IOSana2Req structure had to be changed anyway, many names
in <devices/sana2.h> have been changed to be more consistent with other system
names. It is believed that global search and replace should make this a mostly
trivial change and that the benefits gained from consistent naming outweigh the
inconvenience to those few who have existing SANA-II code.
	- Events are now defined as a bit mask rather than as scalars.

Comment and approval.  Though it is not in standard.txt, you should note for
all devices that promiscuous mode requires exclusive opening of the device.
Ethernet.txt "Station Address" has been changed. There have also been minor
clarifications and typographical corrections and a section was added to clarify
ARCNET framing.

- Packet type specification has been drastically simplified.  Protocols no
longer specify any framing information -- packet magic is eliminated and a
convention is adopted for handling the framing problem faced by ethernet
drivers.
