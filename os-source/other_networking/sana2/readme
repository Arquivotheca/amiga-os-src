                            ------- NOTE NOTE -------

      Developers, please note ...  The standard system location for SANA-II
      network device drivers is in a directory called "networks" which exists
      in the "DEVS:" directory.  Example:

          devs:networks/a2065.device

      This is the official location for these drivers. It may be necessary
      for your install programs/scripts to create this directory.

                            ------- NOTE NOTE -------

      The included A2060 device driver is a BETA driver and should be dealt
      with accordingly. At the time of this writing the driver has NOT
      received the testing that it should.  You can get our attention on
      this subject via email to "networking@cbmvax.commodore.com". Please
      let us know of any problems so we can fix them a.s.a.p.
