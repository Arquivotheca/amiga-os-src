			Things to think about
			---------------------

2. Had to use __stdargs in _Lib{Open, Close, Expunge, Null, AbortIO, BeginIO} 
   because, according to BIX sas.c/amiga.c note, 5.10 has a buggy __asm keyword 
   that doesn't turn off default regargs processing.

	Disposition: use SAS C 5.10b lc1/lc2.


3. sana.fd file must be present (even though this is a device ) to get blink to 
   insert _LibID, _LibName, & func tab into library.  
   
6. Interpretation of packet type stats:

	PacketsSent	- packets that made it do wire
	PacketsReceived	- packets actually returned to application
	BytesSent	- bytes returned to application; if RAW, includes header
	BytesSent	- bytes sent from application; if RAW, includes header
	PacketsDropped	- number of packets dropped in recv/xmit operations
