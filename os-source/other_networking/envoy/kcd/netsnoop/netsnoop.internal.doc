Template:
========

QUERY/K/M, T=MAXTIME/K/N, R=MAXRESP/K/N, IPADDR, REALM, HOST, SERVICE,
ENTITY, OWNER, MACHDESC, CPUFLAG, LIBVERSION, CHIPREV, MAXFASTRAM/N,
AVAILFASTRAM/N, MAXCHIPRAM/N, AVAILCHIPRAM/N, KICKVER, WBVER, NIPCVER,
NAQ=NOAUTOQUIT/S, HELP/S

T=MAXTIME/K/N - max number of seconds to scan (15) 
R=MAXRESP/K/N - max number of responses to process (5000)

IPADDR       - match specific IP address (ex: 169.143.25.69)
REALM        - match specific realm
HOST         - match specific host
SERVICE      - match specific service
ENTITY       - match specific entity
OWNER        - match specific owner
MACHDESC     - match specific machine description
CPUFLAG      - (HEX) match specific CPU flags, see <exec/execbase.h>
LIBVERSION   - match specific library version (ex: "39 106")
CHIPREV      - (HEX) match specific chip revisions, see <graphics/gfxbase.h>
MAXFASTRAM   - match specific amount of fast RAM installed
AVAILFASTRAM - match specific amount of fast RAM available
MAXCHIPRAM   - match specific amount of chip RAM installed
AVAILCHIPRAM - match specific amount of chip RAM available
KICKVER      - match kickstart versions >= this one (ex: "39 106")
WBVER        - match workbench versions >= this one (ex: "39 46")
NIPCVER      - match nipc.library versions >= this one (ex: "39 46")
NOAUTOQUIT   - wait for full amount of time before exiting.  Default
               behavior is to quit if there's no new info for a while.
               With this option, use Control-C to exit.
HELP/S       - print this message.

QUERY/K/M Options:
       ADDRS -- look for all IP addresses
      REALMS -- look for all realms
       HOSTS -- look for all host names
    SERVICES -- look for all services
    ENTITIES -- look for all entities
      OWNERS -- look for all machine owners
   MACHDESCS -- look for all machine descriptions
    CPUFLAGS -- look for all cpu-type flags (execbase)
     LIBVERS -- look for all lib versions
    CHIPREVS -- look for all gfx chip revisions
     MAXFAST -- check max amounts of fast RAM
   AVAILFAST -- check available amounts of fast RAM
     MAXCHIP -- check max amounts of chip RAM
   AVAILCHIP -- check available amounts of chip RAM
    KICKVERS -- look for all kickstart versions
      WBVERS -- look for all workbench versions
    NIPCVERS -- look for all nipc.library versions

Note that the nipc.library version-checking commands are not likely to work
with early (pre-nipc.library 37.107) versions of Envoy, as it was a late
addition...

To exit the program, press control-C at any time.


Notes relevant to release 2.0 (NetSnoop 2.1):
=============================================

A Word Of Caution:
  If the net is severely lagged, the NOAUTOQUIT option is a very good idea.
  Why?  The NIPCInquiry is asynchronous.  Thus, it's easy to crash the NIPC
  stuff if NetSnoop (and thus the hook that is supposed to be executed)
  vanishes in mid-query.  Most of the time, this is no problem.  However, it
  can happen, so the default options are not entirely safe. (This program
  should really be implemented as a resident host/server (a la Drip), or as a
  service, I suppose.)  [This is even worse with MungWall running.  Guess
  what guru you get when you try to jump to $DEADBEEF?  Answer is below.]

New in 2.9:
  - Slight cleanup of help output.
  - Should now exit gracefully under AmigaDOS 1.3.

New in 2.7:
  - Support for checking NIPC version numbers.

Fixed/Changed from 1.0:
  - More convenient keywords, easier-to-read help
  - Immune to Mungwall (but see note below re: libvers).
  - Automatically times out when there hasn't been anything new to print
    for a while.
  - ChipRevs and CPUFlags are printed out in English (they must still
    be input in hex, alas).
  - Beware of the LIBVERS and LIBVERSION options; they're marked as
    unimplemented and (on my machine) generate enforcer hits if used.  The
    other version options don't have this problem.

Be aware that there are some limitations:
    - CLI USAGE ONLY.
    - RESPONSES MAY VARY BETWEEN VARIOUS VERSIONS OF ENVOY ON TARGET MACHINES.
    - Not every part of NIPCInquiry was documented during this writing, thus
      some things like MACHDESC are mysterious (and quite possibly
      not implemented).
    - Not everyone fills in the "owner" info on their machine.

And some features:
    - Info is pretty much complete and accurate.
    - Control-C halts NetSnoop at any time.
    - Much more stable.

And examples:
    netsnoop entity TalkServer query hosts owners
    --> shows all hosts/owners running TalkServer in the local realm
    netsnoop realm SoftEng query hosts owners addrs
    --> shows all hosts/owners and IPAddresses in the SoftEng realm.
    netsnoop query realms
    --> shows all realms
    netsnoop query hosts t=20 r=30
    --> show all hosts in local realm; look for 20 seconds, show 30
        responses.

Guru Answer:
    8000 0003, odd address.  No pre-guru enforcer hits.  (This is from
    the experience of having something like this happen, not from
    actually writing code that jumps to $DEADBEEF. :-)
