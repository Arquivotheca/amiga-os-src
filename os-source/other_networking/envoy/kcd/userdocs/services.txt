Envoy Services
--------------

The Services tool in the configuration drawer is used to add new services
such as a database server or distributed rendering system to Envoy. The
Services tool may also be used to remove or disable previously installed
services such as the Envoy file system or the print spooler.

Adding a new services may be done by one of two ways.  First, the service's
Icon may be dragged into the Services tool's window.  Alternatively, a user
may click on the Add... button and a file requester will open that will
allow a user to select a service to add. Once a service has been added, it
is automatically enabled.

Previously installed services may be removed by selecting a service and
clicking on the Remove button.

If a user would like to temporarily disable a service without removing it,
he/she can click on the checkbox gadget and the check mark will dissappear
to show that the service is no longer enabled.  It may be reenable by clicking
on the checkbox gadget again.

Once the user has finished configuring what services he/she wants, he/she can
click on the Save button to save the configuration.  Alternatively, the
Cancel button can be used to abort any changes that were made.

In order for the changes to take effect, the system will have to be rebooted.
