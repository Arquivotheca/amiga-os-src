Simple Networks
---------------

A simple network is one in which all of the systems on the network
are connected to the same network medium on a small area.  Simple
networks are sufficient when the total number of machines connected
to the network is less than 30.


Internets
---------

An internet is a collection of two or more local area networks (LANS).
Internets are usually used when there are more than around 30 machines
that will be connected to a network.  Internets can help to increase
network performance and also make managing large numbers of machines
easier.  However, internets are much more complex to set up than
simple networks.  Unless you know for sure that you will eventually
have a very large number of machines on your network, it is strongly
suggested that you choose the installation procedure for setting up
a simple network.

For information on how to configure Envoy in an internet, please
consult Appendix X, "Using Envoy on internets.".
