   FUNCTION
	This function provides a means for informing a service as a whole that
	it should try to shutdown within a specified amount of time.

   INPUTS
	desc - Pointer to a string that contains a user-friendly reason of
	    reason of why the service needs to be shut down.  May be NULL.

	seconds - The number of seconds until the end of the world.  This may
	    be 0 if shutdown needs to be done immediately.

   NAME
	GetServiceAttrsA -- obtain information about the service.
	GetServiceAttrs -- varargs stub for GetServiceAttrsA.

   SYNOPSIS
	GetServiceAttrsA(taglist)
			 A0

	VOID GetServiceAttrsA(struct TagItem *);

	GetServiceAttrs(tag1, ...)

	VOID GetServiceAttrs(Tag, ...);

   FUNCTION
	This function provides a method for determining information about
	the service.  Some of this data will be used by Services Manager
	for configuration.  There will also likely be a predefined set
	of Tags for information such as the names of the connected users,
	the current load on the service, etc.  Service implementors will
	also be able to define their own custom Tags for diagnostic/
	statistical purposes.

   INPUTS
       taglist - A tagList containing the tags that you want to get the
	    attributes for.

   TAGS
	Tags defined for GetServiceAttrsA():

	SVCAttrs_Name (STRPTR) - The name of the service you are providing.
	    (Required)


xxx.service/SetServiceAttrsA                     xxx.service/SetServiceAttrsA

   NAME
	SetServiceAttrsA -- set attributes of a service.
	SetServiceAttrs -- varargs stub for SetServiceAttrs

   SYNOPSIS
	SetServiceAttrsA(taglist)
			 A0

	VOID SetServiceAttrsA(struct TagItem *);

	SetServiceAttrs(tag1, ...)

	VOID SetServiceAttrs(Tag, ...);

   FUNCTION
	This function provides a method for setting attributes for a service.
	For instance, a configuration editor for the service may need to change
	the name of the service, permissions, etc.  This function provides
	a standardized method for doing so.

   INPUTS
	taglist - A list of TagItem structures to be used by the service
	    to modify it's operation.

   TAGS
	Tags defined for SetServiceAttrsA():

	SVCAttrs_Name (STRPTR)  - The name of the service you are providing.

xxx.service/StartService                             xxx.service/StartService

   NAME
	StartService -- Accept a new client connection

	d0                   A0        A1        A2

	ULONG StartService(STRPTR, STRPTR, STRPTR);

   FUNCTION
	This function requests that a service take whatever steps are
	required to initiate a connection with a new client. The service
	should fill in entityName with the name of the Entity with which
	you will be accepting client transactions.  If you have any kind
	of problem during startup, return with a non-zero error code. This
	code will be passed back to the client that called FindService().

   INPUTS
	username - Pointer to the name of the user requesting the service.
	password - Pointer to the user's password as sent by the client.
	entityname - Pointer to a buffer to fill in with your Entity name.

   RESULT
	error -	A ULONG describing why you could not start your service. This
	    error code will be passed back to the client that called
	    FindService().
