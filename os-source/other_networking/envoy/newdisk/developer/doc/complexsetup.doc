Several people have requested more detailed information about how
to run Envoy in a complex networking environment.  While supported,
this environment is not the intended target of Envoy.  When the
concepts of 'routers', 'subnets', or 'netmask' enter into the picture,
the situation becomes terribly complicated.

Producing a tutorial on routing, subnetting, or any of the more
complex networking topics is far too formidable a task to enter
into here.  Entire books have been written that only scratch the
surface of explaining these subjects.  One I might suggest that
covers IP, the Network protocol in use in Envoy is 'Internetworking
with TCP/IP', by Douglas Comer.  Volume I.  ISBN 0-13-468505-9.

When installation Envoy, you're asked if you're in a simple or a complex
networking situation.  If this is confusing, the following points might
be helpful:

    - If you have an existing network that you (or someone) runs TCP/IP,
      Novell, or some other protocol on, you're in a complex situation.

    - If you want the ability to talk to another Envoy machine that isn't
      on the same physical network as yours, you're in a complex situation.

    - Universities, Businesses, and large organizations are all usually in
      some sort of complex situation.

    - If you've a handful of Amigas that you want to connect together, you
      are in a simple situation.

 SIMPLE SITUATION

 In a simple network, you should have to provide the following information:

    (a) A name for each machine.
    (b) A unique number for each machine.
    (c) You're asked which networking device you intend to use.

 The concept of Realms is -not- necessary for a simple networking situation.

 COMPLEX, 'internet' SITUATION

 If ANY of your Amigas are on different physical networks, you are required
 to set up and maintain an Envoy Realm Server.  Please reference realms.doc.

 At installation time, if you decide that your networking situation is complex,
 (an 'internet' situation) the installer will ask you several questions:

    (a) You are asked to provide a name for your Amiga.
        This is fairly self-explanatory.

    (b) You are asked to provide an IP address for your Amiga.
        If you are in an already-existing network, these are very likely
        allocated by a central authority.  An IP address is a 32-bit number
        that uniquely identifies your machine.  If you're in a complex
        network situation, ask your network administrator for an IP address.

    (c) You are asked if your network is using the default subnet mask.
        A subnet mask is used to identify which portions of an IP address
        describe which mean "network number" rather than "machine number".
        Ask your network administrator for this information.

    (d) You are asked if you would like to select a network address for a
        default router.
        When several physical networks exist, the problem of figuring out
        what path should be taken to get from a machine on one physical
        network to a machine on a different physical network.  A router
        is either a computer or special piece of hardware acting as both
        a roadmap and traffic cop; directing packets to their destinations.
        Ask your network administrator for this information.

    (e) You are asked for the name of the Realm that your Amiga is in.
        A Realm is a logical grouping of machines into categories.  For
        instance, 'Marketing', 'Design', 'Production', are all examples
        of what different realms might be.  For those confused, this
        is -not- DNS.  Read realms.doc for more information.

    (f) You are asked for the name of your Realm Server.  A Realm server
        is an Amiga that agrees to act as a 'telephone book' -- helping
        to convert the names of specific machines into IP addresses.
        Read realms.doc for more information.

    (g) You're asked which networking device you'd like to use.  Provided
        are Commodore's A2065 ethernet board, Commodore's A2060 ARCNET
        board, and an option to click 'Other'.
