 Differences between DevCon distribution (disk rev 0.92) and 0.105:

===================================
= WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING =
===================================

When you update your Envoy installation to the newest Envoy, be SURE
to check your S:User-Startup file -- old versions of Envoy used to
have two 'RUN' statements there, to start up 'Services Manager' and
'Accounts manager'.  These are now started up by placing the
files in SYS:WBStartup.  The programs were being started from
two different places, apparently giving odd effects.  Therefore:

    DELETE THOSE LINES FROM YOUR USER-STARTUP WHEN UPDATING.

 PS: If on a 2.04 system, Envoy may add an ASSIGN statement to
 your user-startup.  Don't delete that!

===================================
= WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING =
===================================

 'Filesystem Imports' now encrypts the password you enter for storage in the
 mountfile.  The Filesystem server, 'filesystem.service' had to be modified
 to accept both encrypted and unencrypted (old-style) passwords.  HOWEVER,
 for you to use 'Filesystem Imports', the machines you are talking to MUST
 BE USING THE NEWEST REVISION OF 'filesystem.service', or you may well be
 refused access.

 - Icons added for everything except 'Network Printing'.
 - Now distributing the V39 parallel.device, as Darren fixed several
   bugs in it, and feels that between PARNET SANA-II devices and
   parallel-port Ethernet adapters, it'd be a good idea to distribute
   the correct version with Envoy.

nipc.library 37.102 released.

Changes:

        o       Fixed the operation of the NIPCInquiry() tags for
                determining ExecBase->AttnFlags and the four tags
                for finding out how much memory a machine has.  All
                of these would previously return 0.

nipc.library V37.103 released to the server.

 (Covers several changes by both Ken and Greg ...)

    - ARP SANA-II IORequests now increased.

    - Entries in the ARP table now time out.

    - Caching of Buffer and BuffEntry structs turned off.
      (was fragmenting memory)

    - Private Statistics calls expanded to allow external
      viewing of NIPC's routing tables.

    - A fix to MATCH_SERVICE was made to respect Services
      that're currently disabled.

    - With the aid of several EuroDevelopers, I've expanded
      NIPC's awareness of the types of HW attached to it.
      A better numerical guesswork system of what kind of
      network bandwidth can be expected between two machines
      is now in place.  This makes the BPS and MTU values
      returned by a SANA-II device -very- important.
      (Slower devices incur higher timeouts in NIPC.)

      Both trans_Timeout and lower-level RDP timeouts are
      affected.

nipc.library V37.104 released to the server.

    - I found this morning that the work I'd done last week on NIPC
      timeouts was only, say, 25% effective.  It was only being processed
      on the passive end of an RDP connection.  The important side -- the
      -active- side -- was doing nothing.  The result was that things
      didn't improve.  (I finally managed to get a setup where I could
      reproduce a set of bug reports!  Yay!)

----------

accounts.library 37.3 released.

        o       Added support for multiple machines to share a common
                Accounts Manager.  This is enabled by setting the
                environment variable Envoy/AccountsServer to the name
                of the central host.

----------

envoy.library 37.10 released.

        - The user selection requester wasn't compensating for
          the display bar under V37 listview gadgets, so the
          Okay and Cancel gadgets were not getting centered correctly.

----------

Envoy's EnvoyFileSystem V37.13 released to the Envoy tree on the server.

    - Fixed a bug reported by Martin, where doing a 'version' over
      the network filesystem caused an enforcer hit.  I missed a
      special case for packet type 'ACTION_PARENT_FH'.

Envoy's "EnvoyFileSystem" V37.14 has been released to the server.

    - Many people (mostly Willy Langefeld) have complained that
      the requesters that EFS brings up are annoying -- even
      though they time out.  Most of these people have been
      begging for an option to "turn them off".  I dislike such
      options because they're entirely power-user oriented, and
      are likely to confuse Joe-Sixpack.  Nevertheless, I've
      given in and added the low-level support for just such an
      option.

      The flags field in the Unit string in an EFS mountfile now
      has a third option -- 'R'.  If included, that EFS mount will
      NEVER bring up a requester.

      This is only the low-level support -- no point-and-click
      method exists for setting this option, so the only
      recourse for a power-user is manually editing the mount
      files.  Higher-level support may or may not arrive
      soon.

 Envoy's EnvoyFileSystem V37.15 released to the server.

    - The client now has a little bit better retry mechanism,
      and should be slightly more transparent.  (What this means
      to the average user?  Almost nothing.  :') )

----------

Envoy's "Filesystem Imports" 37.11 released to the server.

    - Fixed an Enforcer hit that I found while at DevCon.
      A line of code wasn't cased correctly -- and made the
      mistake of assuming that IAddress of the Intuition
      Message always pointed to a Gadget structure.
      In the case of "Filesystem Imports"' window close
      gadget, it didn't.  :')

Envoy's 'Filesystem Imports' V37.12 has been released to the server.

    - The Host requester window was eight pixels too wide.
      Fixed.

----------

Envoy's "filesystem.service" V37.11 has been released to the server.

    - As per several requests, I essentially changed the strings that
      "Filesystem Imports" sees when trying to import a filesystem.

      The strings presented used to be the true server paths to the
      mount-point.  Now, they're the volume names that the user has
      provided in "Filesystem Exports" (the true server paths are
      defaulted to if no volume name existed).

      The gain is:

        - Things are a heckuva lot more intuitive.  People see the
          same names in the list that they'll see on the workbench.

        - You don't necessarily give away data that you'd prefer be
          private -- like what volumes things actually lie on.

        - In situations like Catfish, where the volume name changes
          depending on which Fish CD revision is in the CD ROM drive,
          people don't have to keep updating their mounts.

      The downside is:

        - To keep compatibility with past revisions, the code allows
          old mountfiles that directly reference the true mountpoint.
          This isn't a real security hole -- merely odd behavior.

Envoy's filesystem.service V37.12 has been released to the server.

    - Fixed a section of code with poor failure handling.  If the
      lock on the target failed, a pointer would be nulled.  Just
      below nulling the pointer, I was trying to reference something
      off of the pointer.  Oops.

Envoy User Configuration 37.8 released.

Changes:

        o       Passwords are now hidden with bullet characters for
                security reasons.

        o       When you log in, your account is automatically selected.

----------



Envoy Group Preferences 37.8 released.

Changes:

        o       Added another kludge to fix visual problems under
                V37.  I wasn't taking into account that V37 listviews
                height parameters are off by 12.

Envoy Groups Preferences 37.9 released.

        - The text gadget for the groups's administrator name wasn't
          getting updated when a new group was created.  Also, the
          gadget was not getting cleared when the current group was
          deleted.

----------

Envoy Network Configuration 37.8 released.

Changes:

        o       No longer requires you to enter 0.0.0.0 to clear out
                the Realm Server IP Address.

        o       Turning off Realms with the checkbox gadget properly
                clears out the Realm Server IP Address and Realm Name.

        o       Removed the Hop count gadget and other related junk from
                the Routes panel, since nipc.library doesn't use it for
                anything right now.

        o       Adjusted the placement of the Destination and Gateway
                test strings on the Routes panel to be centered of each
                part of the listview.

        o       Misc other UI tweaks. :)

= MANAGERS =
============


Accounts Manager 37.8 released.

        - The right logic wasn't being used when determining whether
          or not a user could remove a group.  It was supposed to require
          that the user is the groups administrator *or* that the user
          has admin privs.  It was requiring both.

Accounts Manager 37.9 released to heartofgold.

Change:

        o       I wasn't allocating the right amount of memory for
                my internal group representation, so I was getting
                mungwall hits when Accounts Manager was shut down.
                Thanks to Carolyn and Peter for noticing this.

Accounts Manager 37.10 released.

Changes:

        o       Changing any user flags would cause that user's
                AdminAll flag to be set, and it couldn't be turned
                off.  Fixed since this causes a *slight* security
                problem. :)

(This bug report came in not 5 minutes after the last release....arghhh)

----------

Services Manager 37.11 released.

Changes:

        o       All this time I had been ignoring the enable bit in
                the Service IFF chunk.
