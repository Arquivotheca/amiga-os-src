Features

The Envoy software package will enable all Amiga computers (including the
A500 and A600) to transparently share filesystems and printers with each other.
It will support third-party networking applications.  Easy configuration for
simple networks, and operation in complex network environments will both be
part of the initial package. Security features will unobtrusively discourage
unauthorized use of network resources.  The Amiga GUI will be used extensively
to make the package easy to configure and to use.



Hardware Requirements

Envoy makes use of the SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification, allowing
the package to be used with any networking hardware that has a compliant
device driver.  Envoy can be used on any 512k Amiga running 2.0 or better.



Availability & Distribution

Information on the future availability of Envoy, including plans for
distribution is not available at this time.
