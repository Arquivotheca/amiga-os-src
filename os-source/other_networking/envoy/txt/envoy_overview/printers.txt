Envoy Network Printers



The Envoy client portion of the printer services should consist only of a new device 
which is written to be compatible with the parallel.device.  This device should operate 
(like the parallel device) only in exclusive access mode - where it will do little more than 
transmit all CMD_WRITE's to the remote server, who will queue them up until the local

device closes -- implying an end to the current print session.  At this point in time, the 
remote server will insert it's assembled file into it's output queue to be printed.
