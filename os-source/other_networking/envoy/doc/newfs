 ENVOY FILESYSTEM CHANGES
 ------------------------

 Updated January 11th, 1993
 Updated October 6th, 1993

 With the addition of a level of security to Envoy, the filesystem has
 changed to adapt to this.

 (1) You should delete the file ENVARC:envoy/efs.config
     (and ENV:envoy/efs.config).  The format of this file has
     changed.

 (2) The 'Filesystem Exports' program now -requires- you to specify all
     users capable of accessing given volumes.  For you to do this, you
     must first create these users with the 'Users' program in
     Envoy/Configuration.

 (3) The 'Full File Security' button needs some explanation:
        When this is turned on, a notion of each file having
        a unique Owner (User and Group), and having eight new
        protection bits becomes present.  The owner is the
        user who created the file; the group is the 'default
        group' for that user.  These items can ONLY be changed
        by the owner of the file, and can be done with the
        CLI commands "owner" and "group".

        The new protect bits are rwed for GROUP and rwed for OTHER.
        (The original four bits are consider owner, or USER bits.)
        These can be set ONLY by the owner of a file, using the
        CLI command "protect".

        These new features are available for viewing with the CLI
        command "list".  "list" will default to it's normal
        behavior, but when given the keywords USERS and/or GROUPS,
        will display the valuable data.  Currently, a sample list
        output might be:

11.SoftServe:Greg> list users groups nodates
bloomcounty                  Dir Greg Mille Software E ----rwed r-ed r-e-
11.SoftServe:Greg>               ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^
                                 Owner      Group          User  ||  Other
                                                                Group

        The permission bits granted to a user depends on their level of
        access to the given file; if they're the owner, they receive
        the User bits in the 'User' field.  If they are not the owner,
        but are a member of the group given, the Group bits are
        -copied- into the User field.  For instance, if someone else in
        the "Software Engineering" group were to list the above file,
        they'd see:

bloomcounty                  Dir Greg Mille Software E ----r-ed r-ed r-e-

        If someone in CATS were to list the file, they'd see:
        (Someone in CATS - therefore NOT the owner, and NOT in
         the given group; therefore, someone who falls into the
         OTHER category.)

bloomcounty                  Dir Greg Mille Software E ----r-e- r-e- r-e-


        Files created before 'Full File Security' was turned on may
        have -no- owner.  A file with no owner or group is considered
        owned by anyone -- and may be modified as such.

        Any user with the 'Administration' privilege (see
        Envoy/Configuration/Users) is considered an administrator in
        the filesystem as well.  They can manipulate files as if they
        were always the owner.

        Since DOS doesn't understand any of these protection bits,
        -all- the interpretation of this data is done through Envoy.
        Therefore, a file created on a hard drive but not -through-
        Envoy will not inherit these abilities.

        Many Amiga programs haphazardly "set" the protection bits on a
        file without preserving bits that they don't know about.
        Because the GROUP and OTHER bits are not normally set by the ROM FS,
        these will default to "off".  With Full Security on, unless the user
	explicitly permits a file created without using Envoy it's not accessible.
