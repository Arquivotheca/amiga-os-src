Using Envoy in Internetworked situations
----------------------------------------

If you are using Envoy in a situation where machines are on different
physical networks, you will need to configure NIPC to use Realms. If
all of your machines are on the same network, you may ignore the rest
of this file.


What is a Realm?
----------------

I realm is a collection of one or more physical networks that are
set up to act as one logical network.  This is done by having a
single machine extend NIPC's inquiry capabilites to multiple
phuysical networks.

To accomplish this, the machine that is to be designated as a
Realm Server has to be provided with a list of the network addresses
of all networks within a Realm.  Consider the diagram below.


Backbone Network (135.7.10.0)
----------------+-------------------------------+-------------------
		|				|
		|				|
		+- Harley (135.7.11.2)          |
		|                               |
      Kawasaki -+				+- Chrysler (135.7.12.3)
		|                               |
		+- Yamaha              Pontiac -+
		|                               |
	 Honda -+                               +- Saturn
		|                               |
		|                               |
		|                               |
		|                               |
		|                               |
		|                               |
		|                               |
		|                               |
	Subnet (135.7.11.0)		Subnet (135.7.12.0)


On this network, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is beging used, so
that the first three bytes of the IP address are used to designate each
physical network.

If you wanted the two networks 135.7.11.0 and 135.7.12.0 to act as a
single Realm named Vehicles, you would choose a machine to act as the
Realm Server.   This machine may be on either network, or may even be
on a different network altogether, as long as all of the machines on
both networks are able to communicate with it.  For simplicity, we'll
choose Harley to be the Realm Server.

To configure this, you will first need to run the NIPC configuration
utility on Harley.  Swith to the Realm Configuration panel, where you
will see two listview gadgets.

What you would need to do is add two entries to the lefthand listview
with the following information:

	Vehicles 135.7.11.0
	Vehicles 135.7.12.0

"Vehicles" should be entered into the lefthand string gadget, and
the network addresses should be entered into the rightand string
hadget.

Now, for each machine on both networks, you must run the NIPC configuration
program, and on the first panel, set the Realm Name to "Vehicle" and the
Realm Server Address to 135.7.11.2.  (This should also be done on Harley).

The Remote Realms listview is used for informing a Realm Server of Realms
that are being controlled by other machines.  For example, if you decided
that you had a third network with an address of 135.7.13.0 and wanted to
have it called "Boats", you could add an Entry to the Remote Realms listivew
similar to the following:

	Boats	135.7.13.5

Where 135.7.13.5 is the IP address of the machine that is controlling the
Boats Realm.  Likewise, that machine should have an entry for "Vehicles"
in it's list of Remote Realms that looked like this:

	Vehicles 135.7.11.2

Where 135.7.11.2 is the address of Harley.
