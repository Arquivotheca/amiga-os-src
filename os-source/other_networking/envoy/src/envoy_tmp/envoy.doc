   NAME
     HostRequestA -- Create a std. requester for selecting a host

   SYNOPSIS
     ret = HostRequestA(taglist)
     D0                   A0

     BOOL  HostRequestA(struct TagList *);
     BOOL  HostRequest(tag1, tag2, ...);

   FUNCTION
     Creates a system requester that allows the user to search for and
     select the different hosts and realms known on your network.

   INPUTS
     taglist - Made up of the following possible tags:

           HREQ_Buffer   - Specifies a pointer to the buffer where you wish
                           the resolved host and/or realm name to be stored
                           when the user selected "OK".

                           If a given machine exists in a realm, the string
                           returned will be "realmname:hostname".

           HREQ_BuffSize - Maximum number of bytes allowed to be copied into
                           the above buffer.

           HREQ_Left     - Initial left coordinate of the requester.

           HREQ_Top      - Initial top coordinate of the requester.

           HREQ_Width    - Horizontal size of requester in pixels.

           HREQ_Height   - Vertical size of requester in pixels.

           HREQ_DefaultRealm -
                           Defines the realm to initially search for machines
                           in when the requester first appears.  (String
                           should NOT include a ':'.)

           HREQ_NoRealms - Removes the 'realms' button, and prevents users
                           from switching realms by typing "realm:" in the
                           string gadget.  The response will only contain a
                           hostname.

           HREQ_Screen   - Defines the screen on which this requester
                           should be created.  If not provided, it will be
                           opened on the workbench screen.

           HREQ_Title    - Provides the name for the title bar of the
                           requester's window.

           HREQ_NoResizer -
                           Prevents the requester's window from opening
                           with a resizer gadget; the requester will be
                           locked in at the initial size.
           HREQ_NoDragBar -
                           Prevents the requester's window from opening
                           with a dragbar gadget; the requester will be
                           locked in at the original position.

           MATCH_ ...      Any of the MATCH tags for
                           nipc.library/NIPCInquiry() can be included, and
                           will be used to limit hosts that appear to
                           those that meet the given criteria.

   RESULT
     ret - either TRUE or FALSE, representing whether the requester was
           successful or not.
