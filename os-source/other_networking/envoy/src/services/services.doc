   NAME
	FindServiceA -- Connect to a Service.
	FindService -- varargs stub for FindServiceA().

   SYNOPSIS
	remote_entity = FindServiceA(remotehost, svcname, srcentity, taglist);
	D0                           A0          A1       A2         A3

   	struct Entity *FindServiceA(STRPTR, STRPTR, struct Entity *,
		struct TagItem *);

	remote_entity = FindService(remoteHost, svcname,srcentity,tag1, ...);

	struct Entity *FindServiceA(STRPTR, STRPTR, struct Entity *,
		Tag, ...);

   FUNCTION
	Attemps to locate a certain service on a given host.

   INPUTS
	remotehost - Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that is the name
	    of the host on which the service you want to use is provided.
	    NULL implies the local host.
	servicename - Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that is the name
           of the service you want to connect to.
	srcentity - an Entity returned by nipc.library/CreateEntity() that
	    you wish to use as the 'near' side of the communications path.

   TAGS
       Tags for use with FindService():

	FSVC_UserName (STRPTR) - Specifies the name of the user who is trying
	    to use the service.  If NULL, or the tag is not specified, the
	    call will only be able to connect to a service marked as public
	    on the remote machine.

	FSVC_PassWord (STRPTR) - The password of the user who is trying to use
	    the service.  Only useful in conjunction with FSVC_UserName.

	FSVC_Error (ULONG *) - If specified, a pointer to a ULONG in which a
	    error code describing the failure if there was one.

   RESULT
	remote_entity - NULL if the given service cannot be found or access to
	    the service was denied.  Otherwise, a magic cookie describing the
	    service that you found.

   NOTES
	All of the rules for FindEntity() apply here as well.  Please read the
	Autodoc for FindEntity() for further information.

	Each SUCCESSFUL FindService() REQUIRES an associated LoseService().

   NAME
	LoseService -- Free up any resources allocated from FindService().

   SYNOPSIS
	LoseEntity(entity)
		   A0

   	VOID LoseEntity(struct Entity *)

   FUNCTION
	This will merely free up any resources allocated with a successful
	FindService() call.

   INPUTS
	entity - A pointer to the Entity to use when communication with the
	    server process.

   RESULT
	None

   NOTES
	LoseService() should only be use on entities returned by FindService.
	Attempting to use LoseService() on entities created by CreateEntity
	is asking for trouble.

   BUGS
	None known.
