InfraNet is a simple connectionless udp server, accepting data on its port,
specifically input events, sent by one client. All events are fed to the
input event chain, allowing a networked Amiga to be controlled from one which
runs the client, RemoteControl.

Setting up InfraNet.

InfraNet
	To prevent a funny person from 'taking over your machine' at least one
host must be specified. Run Infranet on target machines on your network and specify
the machine from which you want to accept input. InfraNet can only be run from CLI.

RemoteControl
	RemoteControl is the InfraNet client. It lets you control up to 4 machines
(besides your local host ofcourse). Since it's a commodity, it accepts arguments
as tooltypes. Supported tooltypes are:
HOST1=<hostname>	; target host, bound to HOST1KEY
HOST2=<hostname>	; target host, bound to HOST2KEY
HOST3=<hostname>	; target host, bound to HOST3KEY
HOST4=<hostname>	; target host, bound to HOST4KEY
HOST1KEY=<hotkey>	; hotkey to switch to HOST1, default "numericpad ("
HOST2KEY=<hotkey>	; hotkey to switch to HOST2, default "numericpad )"
HOST3KEY=<hotkey>	; hotkey to switch to HOST3, default "numericpad /"
HOST4KEY=<hotkey>	; hotkey to switch to HOST4, default "numericpad *"
LOCALKEY=<hotkey>	; hotkey to switch back to the local machine
CX_PRIORITY=<priority>	; cx priority this commodity should have

INET:db/Services
	Since InfraNet needs a fixed port number, a line should be added to the
INET:db/Services file, specifying the port number to use. The service name is
"infranet", the protocol "udp". For example:
	infranet	530/udp

Make sure this entry in Services is present on all machines on which you run
InfraNet and on the machine from which you want to control them.

Note that InfraNet is connectionless. So RemoteControl will blindly send
data to the specified address, even though it may be down.

It is not a good idea to specify the local machine as target host... OTOH
you can daisy-chain nodes, by running both InfraNet and RemoteControl on
a target machine. Just make sure the RemoteControl hotkeys on the target
machine are different from the ones you use on your local machine. Again,
make sure you don't build loops...
