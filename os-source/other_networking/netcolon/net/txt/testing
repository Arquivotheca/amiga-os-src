TESTING:
===================================================
recovery from reboot
	during copy
	during read
	while cd is remote
===================================================
reliability (i.e. data integritty with dropped/corrupted
packets)
===================================================
copy one harddrive to another
===================================================
access of df0: when no volume mounted at server init
access of X: where X is a volume in server at init and in drive now
access of X: where X is a volume in server at init but not in drive now
====================================================
delete net:#? all
delete net:#?/#?
delete net:#?/#?/#?
====================================================
dir net:NonExistentNode
====================================================
copy x net:SomeMachine/#?
====================================================
try PRT: and PAR:
====================================================
memory loss?
====================================================
have a half dozen machines do various simultaneous accesses to one server

diskspeed 3.1 to local RAM: produces results in which four diskspeeds each get
from 1/2 to 1/5 the performance of one diskspeed (variance not by which
diskspeed but by which test item).

With more or less as-from-SAS NET:  two different machines diskspeeding
to a third's RAM: drive causes one diskspeed to pause until the other
completes (or damn close to it).
====================================================
what if devs:networks/access/__default__ does not exist?
=====================================================
don't mount speak: on a machine running Bolt (machine "pixie", perhaps.  From
someother machine, then try this dialog:
	<Work:inetsrc/src/net/server> echo "talking via net:" >net:pixie/speak
	echo: unable to open redirection file
	[mount speak: on pixie]
	<Work:inetsrc/src/net/server> echo "talking via net:" >net:pixie/speak
	echo: unable to open redirection file
	<Work:inetsrc/src/net/server> echo "talking via net:" >net:pixie/speak
