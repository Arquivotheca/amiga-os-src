	NET: (network-handler v37.4, network-server v37.8,
	NET-INET.library v1.0)

NET: really needs a better name than "net colon!"  Free beer and pizza for
s/he who thinks up a good name (a "good" name is one I adopt).

This is the first released version for which we have control of the source,
and it is the first version I will hear bug reports for.  I already have
enough bugs to keep me busy for many moons, and I can't recreate source for
earlier versions anyway...

1) copy NET1:network-#? inet:c
2) copy NET1:libs/net-inet.library libs:
3) copy NET1:networks devs:networks all
4) edit files in devs:networks to control access, other machines to
    mount at boot, etc.  (see NET1:net.doc)
5) run inet:c/network-handler to get access to remote machines and run
    inet:c/network-server to let remote machines access your machine.
6) read NET1:net.bugs so that you know what problems to expect
7) at least consider reading NET1:net.doc (it's not much)

Note that the NET1:install script with take can of steps 1-3 for you.

Please report NET: problems directly to dlarson@cbmvax.  Especially if your
NET: problem is workbench or icon related, PLEASE look at the list of known
bugs (NET1:net.bugs) first!
