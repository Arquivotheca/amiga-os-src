I haven't found something that strikes me as 'it' for net colon.
Here is a short list of my favorites, please mail me your one favorite
(not necessarily from this list) so that I can take the one with the most
votes if I can't find one that excites me.

BackdoorLAN (Everyone likes the Doors, right?)
EstablishNET
Digest

TFN (known to outsiders as The File-sharing Network, to us as The F^$%ing Net)

the Compendium Network Filesystem (CNF)
Amiga File Exchange, AFEX
Special File Exchange (Special FX)
Slower File System

Ook.  How about "Interweave", with some nifty artwork showing linked
computers in a net-type picture?

HyperNet.
InterConnect

Worry about the name first, then the acronym.
	Amiga File Share
	Amiga Share
	[replace Share with Snoop]
	Remote Amiga Logical Files (the "Ralph" file system :-)
	Logical Amiga File System (just for laughs :-)
	Long-distance Amiga File Sharing
	Distributed File System
	File Amiga Distributed System (the "fad" file system for dyslexics[sp?]
		and germans :-)
	Slower File System

How about DriftNet for all you dolphin fans?
No, OK, how about NetServe for all you volleyball and tennis fans.
(I seriouly like that one).
Amiga File Exchange, AFEX
Special File Exchange (Special FX)
DragNet (Dum dadumDum)
Liaison
PreferredShare
OpenAccess
(Some of the above are perfectly serious).

From cbmvax!jesup Mon May  6 17:23:20 EDT 1991
	How 'bout GlobalNet?  AmigaLAN?  AmiLAN?  Amiga LAN FS (ALFS, or ALF)?
ALF is pretty easy to wrap your tongue around, unfortunately it's also the
name of a wretched TV show.  That would be ok, but it's also the abbreviation
(and common name) of Amiga Loads Faster, an HD controller from Germany.
	CoNFS or CNFS (Commodore (Network) File System)?  Net Intestines?  :-)
UserNet?  UseNet (oops, taken) ;-)  UniversalNet/UniversalFS?  AmigaTalk?
	Here's a good one: OmniNet or OmniTalk or OmniFS.

From cbmvax!mitchell Mon May  6 17:56:42 EDT 1991
    AmigaTalk?
    AmigaChat?
    Axon?
    AmigaNerve?
    MultiA or Multi-Amiga Network (MAN)?
    FutureNet?
    FuzzyNet?
    PizzaNet? :-)
    PlanNET?
    JanNET?

From cbmvax!peter Tue May  7 10:59:26 EDT 1991
BayoNet
and Mr. Hunt's favorite:
Martinet

From adam@cbmcats Tue May  7 16:03:07 1991
How about ClariNet: ?

rsbx:
TFN stands for ??? (but we know it stands for The Fucking Network)

me:
Backdoor Lan

toebes:
Digest
Compendium (how 'bout CNF - The Compendium Network Filesystem?)
EstablishNET

Seriously, how about WorkShop? It's a collection of joined WorkBenches.
Or Bolt? It bolts your workbenches together.
Then we could have Nets and Bolts :-)

	I still think these aren't bad.  Omni has been as badly abused as
some other things like Hyper and Turbo.  I think OmniTalk is the best - it 
says "it talks to everything".

	TurtleNet?  MolassesFS?  AlphaNet?  MultiFS?  MultiTalk?  OmniServe?
TopspinServe?  MultiServe?

Why not something simple and descriptive like "AmigaNet".

After all, we've got AmigaDOS, AmigaVision, etc..
