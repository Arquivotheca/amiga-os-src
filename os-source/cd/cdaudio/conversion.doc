===============================
conversion 0.0 by Jim Hawkins
===============================

Merges two Studio 16 audio files into a source file for audio CD
suitable for the Clearview Philips CDD521 W/O machine

USAGE: conversion mono|stereo <left-source> <right_source> <output-file> [-s]

The -s switch dictates byte swapping in the data words. This is NOT necessary
for the CDD521, but may be for other W/O machines.


Example:

	conversion untitled_L untitled_R track4.cdda

Will convert the two channel files recored by Studio 16 (saved in Studio 16
format) into one file suitable for feeding BuildCD as CD Audio data.
