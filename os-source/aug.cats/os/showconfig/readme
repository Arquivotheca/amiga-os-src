I just copied an updated version of ShowConfig to

  SoftPublic:Cats/Carolyn/ShowConfig

This version is down to ~8.5K in size. What I did to it is:

  - Turned on the compiler inliner and used registerized parameters

  - Added "static" in front of all functions, except main(). This is to
    allow the inliner to inline these functions

  - Changed all "printf" to "Printf"

  - Changed all %d and %x to %ld and %lx, to keep Printf() happy

  - Added code to open CON: on startup and close it on exit when run from
    WB.

  - Removed the statements to disable CTRL-C. They're not useful since no stdio
    is being done.

  - Removed the opening of exec.library, and uses SysBase directly instead

  - Added code to save and restore A6 in the cputests.asm routines. They
    should have been doing that all along.

  - cputests.asm now knows about 68040 FPUs...
