Optimize methods:

	OT_MOST
		Most accessed files/dirs get floated to top of list in order
		of usage.  Anything not accessed is ignored.

	OT_GROUP
		File pairings, when one file is accessed after another,
		are collated.  Strongest matches actually pair entries,
		remaining matches are checked - if they effect pairs that
		are not already changed - they will be.  This continues
		until all matches are processed.

	OT_DIRS
		All dirs get floated to top of list.  Does not need file.




OT_GROUP:

	For every node, use OPTG_MODE:
		DIRNODE *DNode
		10 pairings
			UWORD	Offset
			UBYTE	Counter

	Process file:
		LastBlock/ThisBlock access are a pair
		Find lesser block, find this in list, find other in list
		In lesser entry, find if offset is available,
			inc counter, otherwise use next (if avail), inc
			counter
	Sort block
		Float all nodes with access's to top.

	Scan block
		Find count of all pairings

	Allocate Pairs (OPTG_PAIR) and fill from block
		DIRNODE	*EntryA;
		DIRNODE	*EntryB;
		UWORD	Counter;

	Free Block

	Sort Pair Block in order of counters

	Scan Pair Block
		If EntryA is not marked:
			if EntryB is not marked:
				Move EntryB after EntryA, Mark EntryA/EntryB
			else
				Move EntryB and all following marked
				entries after EntryA, Mark EntryA
		else
			do nothing

	Scan Pair Block, unmarking all EntryA/EntryB's that are marked

	Free Pair Block

	Done

	root dir??
