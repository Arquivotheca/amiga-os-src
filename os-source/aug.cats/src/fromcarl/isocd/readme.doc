Ben Phister:

	So, this should be a version that you can send out before you go.
Carl and I are working on the documentation, but I'm also trying to wrap
up OptCD as fast as I can.  A lot of it is actually working.  OptCD will
feature an external CLI based recorder that will prepare statistic files
for ISOCD to use with the "Optimize" button.  The optimize in ISOCD will
modify a layout list according to the statistics gathered.

	Support for the "least significant order" bytes, intel style, has
been added to the PVD's and directory entries.  In addition, you can add
the additional path table with the reverse bytes so that the CD can be
read on Windows/Dos etc.  This is set with the -p option.

	An option, -v, will append the ";1" version number to all of the
files.  Both of the options default to off.

	We will miss you greatly around here.  I am sure you will have a
blast in Paris...

	Thanks,

	Kenneth Yeast
