Ben Phister:

	I would have sent you this version last week, but we got Chris
Henry to beat on the program with the Fred Fish CD, CD Online, and other
LARGE tests.  We fixed two bugs in the process: zero length files (a la
Shell in 1.3), and very long file path names.

The following that you asked for have been implemented:

	1) Restrictions on CDFS options.
	2) Program checks that it has at least 10K of stack.
	3) Warns if directory examined is greater than 8 dirs deep (ISO).
	4) Checks disk space if creating image file, or memory if to ram:.
	5) Minor bugs.
	6) Report bytes written in status requester.

Also:
	1) Fixed a bug wherein the last files written were not always
	   correct.
	2) CDFS does not report the ISO date properly, it is one day
	   too fast.  I have implemented an approximate fix, turned
	   on with -d.  Otherwise, the dates generated are ISO correct.
	3) Find is implemented using the AmigaDOS search pattern and
	   Next/Prev.  Try it out.
	4) Add/Del Space option added to insert empty spaces into image.
	   To add, click on locations that are to be followed by the
	   spaces and then choose "Add Space".  Specify the size in
	   sectors and ISOCD will add the entries.  If no position is
	   specified, it will add it after the ISO headers.
	   To delete, mark the "<Empty Space>" entries to remove and
	   click "Del Space".  If none are highlighted, the first
	   available one is removed.

This version should be quite stable.  Let me know if there is anything
else.
