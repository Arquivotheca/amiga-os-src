Ben Phister:

	This is a more complete version of ISOCD.  As long as it checks out
at your end, this should be at a state that you can release it to some
people to check out.  The people at Domark should definitely try this
version.  Most of your suggestions have been added, except for the other
ways of handling the scrolling list.

The following things have been added:
	- Layout File Load will be able to handle files that have been
	  deleted or added to a directory since the layout list was saved.
	  Directories that have been changed, cannot be handled because the
	  entire ISO structure changes.  Extra files are appended to the
	  end of the list.
	- Layout files now contain the option variables as well.
	- Extension sort.
	- There is now a Dir Order and a Dir Group, since these are
	  separate operations.
	- Dates or Sizes are displayed, chosen from the menu or keystroke.
	- "Restore CDFS Defaults" available.
	- OK/Cancel on option window.
	- Various error messages to status area.
	- Many small bugs have been removed.
	- Will try to come up in the largest size possible (-m disables).
	- Friendlier, clicking on Examine without a source, will ask for
	  source, etc.
	- "None" option added to Dir Order and Group.
	- Load/Save Layout File now more dependable.
	- <CTRL> used to insert instead of <SHIFT>.
	- Scrolling list cleaned up.
	- Verify option removed, not decided if this is really needed.
	- ISO dates were not always correct, this is fixed.
	- An option was added to change the file sectors buffered on ISO
	  builds, defaults to 128.

Remaining:
	- Find File.
	- Ability to turn off file.
	- Ability to create empty entries.
	- Some more tuning to multiple select gadget.
	- Estimated time for build.
	- Report bytes written

Let me know if I have missed anything.  I am not sure I can implement your
suggestion on Amiga-X/V with the gadget as I do not know how these keys
will "activate" the gadget.  I await any other suggestions from you.
Thanks a lot!
