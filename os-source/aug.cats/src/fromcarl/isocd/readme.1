Ben Phister:

	We are sending you this version of ISOCD to check out.  It is not
as polished as the final version will be, but it is close.  Please check
it out and give me a call.  I will try to list some of the capabilities:

Options:
	- Sort dirs in various orders
	- PVD fields can be edited
	- Split file to place ISO headers in another file
	- CDFS options available (like SetCDFS), Speed Independent is
	  available for ...
	- Trade Mark will try to find the CDTV.TM in the current directory
	  first (should be available w/ISOCD) or in the directories to
	  be examined.  In any case, it will place the file outside of the
	  directory structure into the beginning of the CD for speed.

Examine:
	- Loads the Source directory into a list (at right) that can be
	  re-arranged independent of the directory layout.  Examine uses the
	  sort orders in options to start some of these re-arrangements.
	  The path table is now in the beginning of the image for speed as
	  well.

Build:
	- Will actually build the ISO image.

Source:
	- Source directory

Image:
	- Image file OR device

Layout File:
	- Will load or save a text file that contains the order of the files
	  after arrangement.

File List:
	- This is a scrolling list with multiple select capabilities (not
	  quite perfect).  You can select the files to be moved by clicking
	  or drag selecting, then, while holding down the shift key, click
	  in the position they are to be placed.

	- Special ISO objects are highlighted and within brackets so they
	  can be moved around if needed (except for the Headers).

All of the actions report the status (which dirs examined, progress bar, etc.)
and allow an abort.

Remaining:

	- Verify option
	- Ability to turn off file
	- Layout File Load will be able to handle files that have been deleted
	  or added to directory.
	- Ability to create empty entries
	- Fine tuning to multiple select gadget (Boy, I wish this had been in
	  Gadtools!)
	- Extension sort
	- estimated time for build

Let me know what you think.   Thanks.

	Kenneth Yeast
