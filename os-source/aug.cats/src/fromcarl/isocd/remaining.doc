TO DO:
	- DOCUMENTATION!!!!


LATER:
	- Option for upper case of all file names
	- Fixed fields in ISO (text) should have spaces instead of nulls.
	- performance test to provide information on estimated time for creation
	- rearrange DIRNODE to use MNODE and Name moved to align on 4-byte boundary
	  (also all remaining elements - this will increase from 34 to 36 bytes)
	- logic for properly buffering intuition events
	- "Turn On/Off" file
	- Verify option
	- requester window's to be centered
	- failure of memory allocation, from heap, will Error() program
	- Alternate keys for gadgets
