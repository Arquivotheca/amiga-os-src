joymouse v40.2
(c) Copyright 1993 Commodore-Amiga, Inc.  All Rights Reserved
Usage: joymouse [XMOVE=n YMOVE=n DELAY=nframes ACCEL CREATEKEYS] OR [OFF]
Defaults: XMOVE=4 YMOVE=4 DELAY=1 and no CREATEKEYS or ACCEL
Re CREATEKEYS see lowlevel.doc SystemControl() and libraries/lowlevel.h
For CD32 game controller mouse emulation. Requires lowlevel.library

Joymouse uses lowlevel.library to read the CD32 port1 game controller
and convert directions and the lower right/left (red/blue) buttons into
mouse input events for CD32 titles which absolutely require the game
controller to emulate the Amiga mouse for Intuition.

The additional CREATEKEYS keyword tells joymouse to turn on the
SCON_AddCreateKeys feature of lowlevel.library SystemControl().
When CREATEKEYS is used, you will also receive RAWKEY events
for all gamecontroller buttons.  Note that you will even receive
RAWKEY events for the directions and buttons which have been
converted to mouse events.  This means that if you ask for MOUSEBUTTON
or MOUSEMOVE events you will see both those AND the created RAWKEY
events for those actions.  You could ignore either (just remember
to ReplyMsg them).  See libraries/lowlevel.h for the port1 RAWKEY
values you will receive.

The ACCEL option adds mouse acceleration.  This should not be
used in drawing programs, and probably shouldn't be used in programs
for young children, since it makes the pointer harder to control.
But it can be good for titles with widely spaced things to click
on.  For a HIRES LACE screen, try XMOVE=6 YMOVE=6 ACCEL [CREATEKEYS].
 
If joymouse is required, it should be used only if running under V40+,
and only in startup-sequence (since if user started you from an icon,
they would have a real mouse).  Although if the user has a real game
controller you may want to use joymouse even if started from an icon.
If your application exits, be sure to do JOYMOUSE OFF.

Will return RETURN_FAIL if lowlevel.library is not available.
Will return RETURN_WARN if joymouse is already running.
