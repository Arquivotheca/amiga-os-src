Bugdig will take a terse mode BIX download of a range of messages
from one BIX topic, put the messages in thread order, and convert
them to a Unix mail file.  Original messages and comments to
messages outside the downloaded range will be individual mail
messages ("From" messages) in the resulting file.  Comments to
messages within the download will be appended to the original
message as "Comment_From".

Before submission to bug database, the output of bugdig must be edited to:

   - Remove chatter and irrelevant comments or threads

   - Change any "Comment_From" messages/threads which are bugs in
     their own right into "From" messages, if necessary moving
     the new "From" message and successive comments belonging with
     it to the end of the file.

   - Enter the Subsystem: and Subject: for each "From" bug


When completed, the resulting file must be passed (not Mailed!) to
the keeper of the cbmvax bug database (ie - put it someplace secure
and mail cbmvax!bugs to tell them where it is)
