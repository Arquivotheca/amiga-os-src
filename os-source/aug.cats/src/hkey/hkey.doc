HKey is a handy HotKey commodity to attach programs to function keys.

It is based on a lot of code stolen from the early FKey example.


HKey, plus a sample HKey.info, plus hkey.doc are in
    /cats/public/Amiga/InhouseTools



It is not state of the art, and although you can enter new key definitions
in the HKey commodity window, new key definitions entered this way will only
last until you kill HKey or power off.


To permanently enter your desired hotkeys, you must do so by using WB Info
(Information) on the HKey icon, and enter them as ToolTypes.


HKey has the original IHelp functions built-in, plus my additional
shell-to-front internal command.  All internal commands are specified
with a "@" in front.  This tells HKey it is an internal command, not
something to be System()'d.

Here are HKey's built-in functions:


	@cycle		brings the back window to the front
        @makebig	makes the active window big
        @makesmall	makes the active window small
        @shelltofront   brings the first non-front shell it finds to the front

For the rest of your hotkeys, just specify the command you want fired up.

Here is a sample set of HKey ToolTypes:

	alt F6=sys:utilities/calc		(my hex calc from InhouseTools)
	alt F7=h:DebTools/wack
	alt F8=newshell >NIL: from s:shell-startup
	alt F9=@shelltofront
	alt F10=@cycle
	CX_POPUP=NO			(tells it not to open window on startup)
	DONOTWAIT			(tells wbstartup not to wait)


With DONOTWAIT specified, you should be able to put HKey in your wbstartup
drawer to have it automatically started when you boot.

Note that I like to put my definitions on "alt Fn" keys
(or "shift alt Fn" keys) so that they do not interfere with
my editor's function key macros, etc. But HKey will accept settings
for any of the following four types of function keys:

	Fn=
	shift Fn=
	alt Fn=
	shift alt Fn=
