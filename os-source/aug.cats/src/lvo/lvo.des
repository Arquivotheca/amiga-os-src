LVO 37.3 (c) Copyright 1993 Commodore-Amiga, Inc.  All Rights Reserved

LVO is a tool which is used with the Amiga FD files to look up
function LVO's, function descriptions, and also to generate
command lines for the Wedge tool (not included).  The V40 FD
files are included in this archive.

Version 37.3 of LVO adds the EQUATES keyword which tells LVO to
output the LVO's in assembler EQU format.
