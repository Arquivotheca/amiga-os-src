Slider is a program which creates presentation slides on the fly from a
troff-like ASCII file of "slider" macros, commands, and text.

Slider can be used as the final presentation program, or you can just
use slider to lay out your slides, then run slider with its SAVE option
to save all of the slides and sequentially numbered ILBMs for display
using another presentation product (such as AmigaVision or Display).

Advantages of using Slider as your presentation tool:
   - It's easy to create and change slides one any Amiga.
   - You can edit your slides easily with any text editor.
   - You just need to carry slider, your slidefile, and any special fonts,
     backgrounds, brushes, or demos you are using. It's compact.
   - No dongles
   - I keep it working on every new Amiga and Amiga OS
   - If you like, you can have slider save out all of your slides
     as sequentially numbered ILBMs, for use in another display program

Disadvantages of using Slider as your presentation tool:
   - Really lame transitions compared to Scala.
   - No built-in animation or sound (but can call sound/anim players)
   - Some delay from when you click till when next slide appears
     (it's being rendered)


SLIDER OVERVIEW
===============
Slider generates and display presentation slides from a "slidefile".
A "slidefile" is an ASCII text file of slide text and slider commands.

Slidefile lines that start with a period (.) are potential command lines.

Slider will ignore all lines that start with (.) which except for
the following legal slider commands:

.SS			(a slide start)
.SC <command and args> 	(a specific slider command)
.SE 			(a end)

Plain text lines between a .SS and a .SE will be rendered.


Example:

.SS				(start of slide)
One line of text		(text to render)
.SC pen 3			(slide command to change pen number)
Text in different color		(text to render)
.SE				(end of slide)

Slider commands enable font loading and selection (with softstyle support
and width scaling support for outline fonts), defineable outline or drop
shadow width and placement (up to two at once), brush loading and placement,
position control, centering, bulleting, drawing of filled boxes (for use
as underlines or text boxes), pauses, and both synchronous and asynchronous
execution of external programs.

Slider macros (commands bracketed by .SC macro name and .SC endm)
can be defined an called by name (.SC name) within your slidefile.
It is common to have a body macro for resetting font attributes
for body text, and a heading macro to set the attributes for a heading.

.SS
.SC heading		(defined previously in slidefile)
My Heading Text
.SC body 		(defined previously in slidefile)
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
.SE


The background for your slides can be either an ILBM (in which case slider
will use the palette of the ILBM), or a built-in blank background
(NOBG which is hires non-interlace, or LACEBG which is hires interlace)
in a slight overscan size of 656x216 (or 640/432) which should fit on most
display devices.  The WIDTH and HEIGHT keywords/tooltypes may be used
to adjust the size for blank (NOBG) or blank lace (LACEBG) backgrounds.
A command is provided for controlling the palette of the built-in background.
Suggested palette for all backgrounds is to use pens 0-3 as follows:

	0 - background color
	1 - main text color
	2 - main shadow/outline color
	3 - highlight/alternate text color
	4-15 - alternate pens

However, slidefiles can easily be adapted to use upper or other pens for
text and shadow.  Slider can load new ILBMs to change backgrounds, but
they must be the same size and depth as the command-line (or tooltype)
specified background file.

Note:
Some sample slide files may have troff macros at the beginning which are
ignored by slider (they start with ".") but they allow the slidefile to
be processed with troff to output just the text of the slides (plus
special inserted notes) for use as hardcopy notes.


USING SLIDER TO DISPLAY A SLIDE FILE
====================================

CLI USAGE:

slider help 	prints list of commands

slider		would display a slidefile named slides on an ILBM
		named background

slider myslides LACEBG
		would display a slidefile named myslides on a blank
		interlace background

slider myslides mybackground	(obvious)

slider myslides mybackground SAVE ram:pics/slide
	Assuming you have already created a directory called ram:pics,
	this tells slider to display myslides on mybackground and
	save them all as numbered ILBM's in ram:pics as slide0001,
	slide0002, slide0003, etc.


WB Usage:

Make a project-type icon for your ASCII slidefile.
Using Workbench "Information" set the default tool of the Icon to Slider.
If you have a background ILBM, set a tooltype of BGNAME=yourbackground,
else set either LACEBG=TRUE or NOBG=TRUE.


WHILE RUNNING SLIDER
====================

Press left mouse button (or space bar) to go forward.
Press right mouse button (or backspace) to go backwards.
The "<" key takes you back to the beginning.
The "f" key fades out the display.


SUMMARY OF SLIDER SLIDEFILE COMMANDS
====================================

These are the commands that can be used in a slider file by preceding
them with a left-justified ".SC".

Example:

.SC fontnum 3


Some of these commands are often only called once in a "setup" macro
called by the title slide of a show.  Commoands can be grouped in
defined macros so that the nacro command can just be called within
the slide show.

Note: in all commands, "l" means a number of lines, "#" means a number


Slide Start and End
===================

.SS	signifies start of a slide for display
.SE	signifies end of a slide for display (calls update and pause)

Slide commands (.SC command) can appear between .SS and .SE.
All plain text between .SS and .SE will be rendered as slide text
(unless also bewteen a .SC notes and .SC endnotes command pair).

All macros should be defined BEFORE the first slide start (.SS).


Spacing and Movement (See also Special Characters)
====================

leftmargin #
	set left margin (in pixels), built-in default is 12

topmargin #
	set top margin (in pixels), built-in default is 8

charspace #
	set pixel space between characters

center l
	center the next l lines.  commonly used by defining centeron and
	centeroff macros which respectively do center 9999 and center 0.

vertmove #
	explicit vertical move # number of pixels (+/-).
	Commonly used in a heading or body macro to add extra space
	between heading and body text.


Pens, Shadows, Boxes
====================
pen #
	set current pen to this pen number

savepen
	non-nesting save of pen number

restorepen
	non-nesting restore of saved pen number

bgpen #
	set background pen to this number (deferred till next slide or dobg 0)

shadpen # (and shadpen2 #)
	set this shadow pen to this pen number

shadow (and shadow2) w h xoff yoff
	set shadow to specified width, height, x offset (+/-), y offset (+/-)
	The shadow will be your text (or box) renderedw times from left to
	right and h times from top to bottom, starting at offset x y from
	where your text will be.  I.e., for a 1-pixel outline, specify
	shadow of 3 3 -1 -1.  For a 1 pixel outline on top/left and a
	2 pixel right/bottom edge specify shadow of 4 4 -1 -1.  For a
	same-size drop shadow try 1 1 3 3.  Shadow2 is a second shadow
	that will also be applied (in shadpen2) if set to other than all 0.

box x y w h 
	In current pen number, draw a filled box from upper left x/y
	in size width w and height h. Used for underlines and boxes.
	Current shadow will be applied.
	Special values:
	If y=0, will be drawn under previous line of text.
	If w=0, width will be adjusted to appear centered.
	If h=0, height will be adjusted to appear centered.


Bullets
=======
bullet l (not commonly used - see @ command in Special Characters)
	bullet the next l lines
 
bulletpen # (not commonly used - for character bullets only)
	set bullet pen to number

bulletstring string (not commonly used - no spaces allowed in string)
	sets bullet character(s) to string (see bulletbrush command) 

bulletoffs x y (not commonly needed)
	offset for rendering of bullet. x offset can indent bullets more.

bulletbrush filename
	load ILBM brush filename for use as bullets


Special Characters
==================

@	Used at beginning of any text line, means bullet this line
	Bulleted lines are never centered.

@@	(invisible bullet)
	Used at the beginning of any text line means indent same as
	a bulleted line, but don't render bullet.

-	Used alone on a text line means 1/4 linefeed

=	Used alone on a text line means 1/2 linefeed

	Note - a blank line is a full linefeed


Fonts
=====
loadfont 1-8 name.font fontsize [XDPI YDPI] [italic bold soft]
	load font number n as name.font size fontsize, optionally with
	width scaling, optionally setting softstyle.  By using numbers
	1 through 8 you can load up to 8 differemnt fonts/sizes.
	Commonly done once in a "setup" macro.
 
fontnum 1-8
	make font number n (previously loaded) the currently used  font.


Backgrounds and Brushes (see also bulletbrush with Bullets commands)
=======================
 
loadbg 1-2 filename
	replaces main background (1) or loads an alternate background.
	should be same size an initial command line / tooltype background.

setbg 0-2
	sets background n as current background (0 is blank background)

dobg 0-2
	force rendering of background 0-2

addbrush filename x y [jam2]
	load and add ILBM brush filename at position x/y, optionally
	in JAM2 (erase background) mode.

showilbm filename
	load and show filename ILBM

palette 0xhhh [0xhhh...]
	allows you to change the 4-bit-per-gun palette for slider's
	built-in blank background.


Assorted
========
setpointer on|off
	turn mouse pointer on or off

update
	force refresh of visible slide from hidden rendered slide.

pause
	calls update and then waits for a left mouse click.
	Used when displaying one text line at a time.

wbpause
	updates display, brings Workbench to front, then pauses

syncsys command and args
	synchronously calls specified external program and args
	(returns when external program is exited)
	9example use - Display a pretty picture)

asyncsys command and args
	asynchronously calls specified external program and args
	(returns immediately) (example use - pay a sound sample)

pubscreentofront [screenname]
	bring named or default pubscreen to the front

pubscreentoback [screenname]
	bring named or default pubscreen to the back

Macros
======
Macros allow you to define subroutines for common groups of commands
such as the font and color desired for any headings and the font and
color desired for any body text.

macro name
	starts the definition of a macro (multiline) command
	Macros should be defined prior to the first slide start (.SS).
	A macro may be called by name like built-in slider commands.

endm
	end definition of a macro command

Example macro definition:

.SC macro bigblue
.SC fontnum 3
.SC pen 7
.SC endm

Example use of above macro (would execute the command defined above):

.SC bigblue


Embedded Notes
==============

.SC notes
	tells slider that all following plain text lines are just
	notes, not text for slides, until a .SC endnotes command
	is encountered.

.SC endnotes
	signifies end of notes.  Troff or other processing could
	extract the notes and print them with your slide text for
	hardcopy.


Transitions
===========

fade on (or fade off)
	tells slider to always fade your slides to black and fade
	in next slide.  Generally annoying.  If you need a temporary
	fade when using slider, press "F".

settrans none/wipe_lr/wipe_rl/wipe_tb/wipe_bt/slide_up
	sets slider's default transition to one of the above.
	these transitions are pretty crude (no double buffering)
	but you may find them acceptable.
