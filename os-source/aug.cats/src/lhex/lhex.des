LHEX 40.10  LHA/LZH archive extraction Utility
=============================================
Freely redistributable

Changes:

LHEX 40.10 adds the "-f" and "-F" options.  The "-f" option tells LHEX
to overwrite existing files if possible, without asking (i.e they are
overwritten if not protected against overwriting).  The "-F" option tells
LHEX to overwrite even files that are delete/write protected.
This LHEX also adds the ability to specify destination directories in
quotes (a feature requested by a developer of a dearchiver front end).
To accomplish this, the -w option may now be followed by a space
followed by the destination path. (eg. -w "Ram Disk:")

LHEX 40.8 just makes LHEX print help instead of error on "lhex ?"

LHEX 40.7 removes default behavior of using file attribute bits
stored in the archive, and adds the -a option flag to specify that
the file attribute bits should be applied to the extracted files.
Default behavior is now to set the file attributes to rwed.
The default behavior was changed because it was inappropriate
for LhA archives which were created without the LhA -a option.
NOTE - this means that if you have scripts or docs which
specify the use of LHEX, and you want your archive's file attributes
preserved, you must change your scripts/docs to use the -a option.

Also new for LHEX 40.7 is the LHEX <filelist capability which allows
you to specify the files you wish extracted by listing them in a
file, rather than on the command line.
Thanks to Andy Finkel for making the 40.7 changes.

Bugs: Does not extract file comments
      Error messages say "LhA: ..." as in original Unix sources
