USAGE:
    SNOOP

PURPOSE:
    To report memory allocation and deallocation

SPECIFICATION:
    SNOOP is a utility to display any memory allocations and deallocations
    made by AMIGA tasks/processes.  It does so by intercepting calls to
    the EXEC funtions AllocMem and FreeMem and reporting any actions to
    the user through a terminal connected to the AMIGA's serial port.

$00000080= FreeMem($0002A708,  128) A:00FD3E2C C:00002236   "Workbench"
$0002A708=AllocMem(   128,$0000002) A:00FD3E12 C:00002236   "Workbench"
$00000080= FreeMem($0002A708,  128) A:00FD3E2C C:00002236   "Workbench"
$00000010= FreeMem($00029AB8,   12) A:00FE05EE C:000049B4   "Clock"
$00000010= FreeMem($00029208,   12) A:00FE05EE C:000049B4   "Clock"
$00000010= FreeMem($00027F68,   12) A:00FE05EE C:000049B4   "Clock"
$00000010= FreeMem($00027120,   12) A:00FE05EE C:000049B4   "Clock"
