ToolMenu 37.3

ToolMenu is a tool that allows you to add Applications and Commands
to the Workbench "Tools" menu.

ToolMenu may be toggled ON (or OFF) by double clicking it from workbench.
You can place ToolMenu in your wbstartup drawer to have it start up
automatically whenever you boot.  If placed in wbstartup drawer, you must
have the tooltype DONOTWAIT in the icon.

Use the Workbench Icon/Information feature to enter ToolTypes in the icon
for the applications/commands that you want to appear in the Workbench
"Tools" menu.  Use the following format for each item:

MenuItemName=application
MenuItemName=path/application

for example:

      Wack=h:MyTools/Wack
      DPaint=h:MyTools/DPaint
      Calculator=Calculator


If you need to set the current directory, stack size, or priority for
the command, use multiple statements separated by Left-Amiga+CTRL-J
(this will insert a CTRL-J which appears as a square into the string).

For example:

       VT100=cd work:comm<Left-Amiga+CTRL-J>vt100
       MyEditor=stack 10000<Left-Amiga+CTRL-J>work:mytools/MyEditor



ToolMenu (with at least Kickstart 36.260) also supports passing Workbench
arguments to your commands in the WB Tools menu.  Select the icon(s) you
wish to pass, and then select your command in the Workbench Tools menu.

Define your command with [] where you want any arguments inserted,
either within the command or at the end of the command.  If you do
not have a [] in your command, no arguments (selected icons) will be
inserted.

Example: Hex=type [] hex
	 List=list []


Note for CLI purists - ToolMenu uses commodities ArgArrayInit, so you should
also be able to specify the arguments via command line, in the same format.
