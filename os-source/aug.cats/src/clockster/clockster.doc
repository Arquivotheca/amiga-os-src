Clockster is a decidedly bad but incredibly handy little clock program.

It's bad because it pops up on the front screen, whatever that might
be.

But it's handy because you never have to rearrange any windows to
find out what time, date, or day it is.

I have "c" aliased to call clockster, and I also have HKey pop
it up as a hotkey function (see hkey.lzh).  So I can pop
up clockster in the middle of whatever I'm doing to find out
whether it's time to eat... past time to go home... etc.
