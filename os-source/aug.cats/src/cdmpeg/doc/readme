AmigaCD32 MPEG player  (Wayne D. Lutz, C. Scheppner)

CDMPEG is an executable which plays MPEG tracks on the AmigaCD32
giving the user a few options to choose from.  This player may be used
by AmigaCD licensees, and parts of its code may be incorporated by
AmigaCD licensees into their own original software for the Amiga CD32.

Modifications:

v1.10 - It was found that full black (0,0,0) as the MPEG BORDER color
and/or display screen background color could cause loss of sync on some
S-Video monitors.  This new version of CDMPEG incorporates a DoBorder()
call to set the MPEG border to an off-black, and also sets the default
CDMPEG screen color 0 to an off-black.

USAGE:

The simplest invocation of cdmpeg is:

1.> cdmpeg track#

Its template is as follows:

TRACK/A/N,BACK/K,LMBABORT/S,RMBABORT/S,FIREABORT/S,LACE/S,INFO/S:

The directory IFFP contains SASC .o files compiled from the source
found in the NewIFF39.lzh archive which was distributed on the 1993
DevCon disks. If you a compiler other that SASC 6.x, you may need to
recompile these .c files.
