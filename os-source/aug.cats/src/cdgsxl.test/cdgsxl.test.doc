This version of cdgsxl is an inhouse testing version that has the
added feature of being able to specify the command line argument
CDTV, which will force cdtv.device to be used as opposed to cd.device.

This feature was added because cd.device appears to pause sometimes
when playing back a CDXL file. The CDXL file where this problem is
most evident is one that is found on the cd called:

        "The Demo, Collection for Amiga CDTV"
                by Almathera Systems LTD

The file is in the CDXL directory and is named vista2.xl. Other CDXL
files also exhibit this problem but this one does it best.


Example cdgsxl invocations:

> cdgsxl cd0:CDXL/vista2.xl

OR for cdtv.device

> cdgsxl cd0:CDXL/vista2.xl CDTV

Another version of cdgsxl called cdgsxl.kprint has been put here also.
This version has the following dubugging kprintf lines added to the 
interrupt routine that is called by the device every time a transfer 
list is completed:

    if ( !(CDXL_OB->flags & CDTV_DEVICE) ) {
        if ( CDDeviceMReq->io_Actual % cdinfo.SectorSize ) {
            kprintf("%ld: 0x%lx %ld ",Count,xl,CDDeviceMReq->io_Actual);
        } else {
            kprintf("%ld: 0x%lx %ld!!! ",Count,xl,CDDeviceMReq->io_Actual);
        }
    } else {
        int    actual = (CDXL_OB->FrameSize*Count);

        if ( actual % DEFAULT_SECTOR_SIZE ) {
            kprintf("%ld: 0x%lx %ld ",Count,xl,actual);
        } else {
            kprintf("%ld: 0x%lx %ld!!! ",Count,xl,actual);
        }
    }

RunCDXL.kprint.c contains the same source as RunCDXL.c with the
exception of the above debugging lines in the interrupt code. Copy
this file over RunCDXL.c if you wish to recompile the code.
