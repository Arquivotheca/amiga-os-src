Wedge 37.1 (c) Copyright 1990-93 Commodore-Amiga, Inc.  All Rights Reserved

Wedge allows you to wedge into any system function for debugging
purposes.  Wedge 37.1 features SegTracker support plus reduced
stack usage to prevent blowing out of small system handler and task
stacks when locale is present (locale increases the stack usage of
RawDoFmt which is used by kprintf).

Use the LVO tool abd the FD files to easily generate wedge command lines.
