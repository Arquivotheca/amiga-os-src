	* Localize v2.9
	  - Strings that are found in #define statements are now flagged
	    as 'D' instead of 'E'.  This is for the developers who have
	    begun localization by moving all strings to an include file.
	    
	    Globally replacing 'D' with 'S' will localize the #defines.

	    Beware of #defines used to initialize statically allocated
	    structures.

	* Localize v2.7
	  - Added string and function exclusion capability

	  - Added support for nested comments

	  - Null strings are not localized
	  
	  - minimum keyword sets minimum length for a string
	    localize will not localize strings shorter than the
	    minimum.

	* Localize v2.6
	  - clarified explanation of E vs S when the string is
	    part of a #define

	  - Added support for C++ style comments (//)

	  - localize now complains of strings that are too long
	    and tries to recover.
