	Format:	    NOTIFY {files} [AGAIN] [CALL <command>

	Template:   FILE/A/M, AGAIN/S, CALL/K

	Purpose:    To pause until a file or directory is altered

	Specification:

	NOTIFY is an implementation of the 2.04 StartNotify/EndNotify
	functions.  It does not work on NFS or ENVOY filesystems.

	If you pass the name of a file, NOTIFY will block until that
	file is closed.  The file need not exist when NOTIFY is
	started.

	If you pass the name of a directory, NOTIFY will block until
	any file in that directory is closed.

	Renaming, linking, or changing protection bits do not count.

	Any number of files and directories may be supplied.

	AGAIN will cause NOTIFY to enter a loop where it will print
	the name of the file or directory where the close occurred,
	then block waiting for another close.

	CALL allows you to specify a command line to be run when the
	notification occurs.  The command line is passed through
	sprintf and any occurrance of %s is replaced with the name of
	the file/directory.

	Examples:


		NOTIFY ram:

	Return as soon as any file in ram: is closed.


		NOTIFY ram: AGAIN

	Print "ram:" any time a file in ram: is closed.


		NOTIFY ram: CALL "echo BEEP!"

	Print "BEEP!" as soon as any file in ram: is
	closed, then return.


		NOTIFY ram: AGAIN CALL "echo BEEP %s"

	Print "BEEP! ram:" any time a file in ram: is closed.
