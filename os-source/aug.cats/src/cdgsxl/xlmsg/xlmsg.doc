xlmsg.c is source to a program which demonstrates how to communicate
with cdgsxl through exec Messages and Message Ports.  To test xlmsg
do the following from the CLI.


> run cdgsxl xlfilename MSGPORTNAME xlport
> xlmsg xlport

The MSGPORTNAME forces cdgsxl to create a MsgPort named 'xlport'. This
port name is then passed into xlmsg (xlmsg xlport). xlmsg sends 2 messages
to cdgsxl. A XLM_CMD_QUERY message and a XLM_CMD_ABORT message.

The message structure that cdgsxl uses for its MessagePort communication
is as follows:

typedef struct XLMessage {
    struct Message	msg;
    ULONG		command;
    ULONG		status;

} XLMESSAGE;

Where command can be one of XLM_CMD_QUERY or XLM_CMD_ABORT. XLM_CMD_QUERY
just does a query on cdgsxl and returns status bits in the XLMESSAGE status
member. XLM_CMD_ABORT causes cdgsxl to abort.

If cdgsxl is started with the MSGPORTNAME keyword, and it finishes playing a 
CDXL sequence before it recieves a XLM_CMD_ABORT command, it will wait without 
closing down its screen for either a XLM_CMD_QUERY command or a CTRL_C break.

If cdgsxl is started with the MSGPORTNAME keyword, and it recieves a XLM_CMD_ABORT
command before it finishes playing a CDXL sequence, it will abort playback and
close down everything, forgoing any waiting.

At any time you can query the state of cdgsxl by sending a XLM_CMD_QUERY
command to cdgsxl.  cdsgxl will set bits in the status field which represent
its state. Also if cdgsxl gets a XLM_CMD_ABORT command, it will set the status
bits to let you know what was happening just prior to recieving the command.

Currently only the following status bits are supported:

 XLM_STATUS_PLAYING  // cdgsxl is playing a CDXL sequence

 XLM_STATUS_ABORTING // cdgsxl is in the process of aborting.
