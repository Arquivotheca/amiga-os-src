Added the NOLOWPASS keyword. If this keyword is specified, cdgsxl
will turn off the audio low pass filter.

---------
931015 V1.50

Added the PATCHOPENWB keyword. If this keyword is specified, cdgsxl
will temporarily SetFunction() OpenWorkbench() so that is does
nothing. This is useful for when cdgsxl is used as an intro to a
title, and you do not want the OS to force the Workbench screen to
open when the CDXLScreen is closed, which will happen if it's the
only screen open in the system.

This version adds better VIEW support. When run with the VIEW
keyword, cdgsxl opens a view as opposed to a screen. Now this
view is positioned/centered better.

---------
930924 V1.48

This version adds a slight delay (Delay(14)) between the READ of
the CDXL header and the starting of the double-speed CDXL playback.
This compensates for a cd.device problem where doublespeed could
occasionally fail to be turned on if the device was currently
pre-fetching the start of the same doublespeed read or CDXL data.

The CDGSXL player encountered this problem occasionally because of
the shortness of the time between its read of the CDXL header and
its starting of the CDXL doublespeed play of the data positioned
right after the header.

To insure that you avoid this problem in your own code, you may wish
to insert a Delay(14) prior to starting doublespeed read or double
speed CDXL playback.  Alternately, we expect a new SetPatch soon
which will insert the same delay into any CDCONFIG commands which
change the drive speed.
