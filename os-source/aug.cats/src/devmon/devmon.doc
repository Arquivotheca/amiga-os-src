USAGE: devmon name.device unitnum [remote] [hex] [allunits] [full]

Devmon is for debugging device IO problems.  By default, its output
goes to a buffer which can be saved to a file or flushed when full.
By default, it wedge just the device vectors.

options:

remote	- send output to serial
hex	- show more of the output in hex
allunits- show activity of ALL units (necessary to monitor devices
		which allocate a new unit for each opener)
full	- wedge into lots of exec device IO functions also


Example usage:

devmon trackdisk.device 0 full


Note - IOAudio requests are structured differently and do not match the
output format of devmon.
 
Warning - as with any reentrant debugging tool that uses the caller's
stack, a crash can occur if the caller has a very small stack.
So far, we have only seem such crashes under 1.3.
