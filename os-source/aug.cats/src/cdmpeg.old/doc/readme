CDMPEG is an executable which plays MPEG tracks on the AmigaCD32
giving the user a few options to choose from. The simplest invocation
of it is:

> cdmpeg track#

Its template is as follows:

TRACK/A/N,BACK/K,LMBABORT/S,RMBABORT/S,FIREABORT/S,LACE/S,INFO/S:

The directory IFFP contains SASC .o files compiled from the source
found in the NewIFF39.lzh archive which was distributed on the 1993
DevCon disks. If you a compiler other that SASC 6.x, you may need to
recompile these .c files.

See docs for further info.
