USAGE:
    DRIP [<threshold>]

PURPOSE:
    To reveal unrestrained memory allocation or deallocation

SPECIFICATION:
    DRIP  is a tool used in program development that reports unrestrained
    memory allocation or deallocation.  For instance, if a program is
    suspected of failing to free memory which it has aquired, DRIP can be
    used to reveal any memory left allocated after the program has been
    terminated.  DRIP should be executed initially to allow it to install
    itself (by creating its own message port).  DRIP also has  a provision
    for a threshhold which causes it to report a loss/gain only if it is
    greater than <threshold>.  <threshold> should be given in decimal.  If
    it is not supplied then DRIP assumes it to be zero.

EXAMPLE:

    First initialize DRIP; <threshold> is zero.

    1> drip

    Run suspect program.

    1> myprog

    Terminate suspect program.
    Report any memory net gain/loss.

    1> drip 1024
    ==========>> drip: lost 2203 bytes

    According to DRIP 2203 bytes were not freed by myprog.
