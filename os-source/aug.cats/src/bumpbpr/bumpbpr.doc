Emulates the V39+AA rounding up of the BitMap width (BytesPerRow) of Screen
bitmaps and displayable AllocBitMap'd bitmaps of the higher bandwidth modes.
Use on non-AA or non-promoted V39 machines to test for many BytesPerRow
compatiblity problems.  Test with bitmap/screen widths not divisible by 64.
