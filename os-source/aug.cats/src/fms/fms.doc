		    FILE BASED TRACKDISK SIMULATOR

    * Useful for creating a floppy-like partition on your harddisk
      (so you can diskcopy to a floppy) WITHOUT actually having to
      create a special partition for it.

    * Useful for testing new filesystems and such

    * Up to 32 Units, OFS or FFS selectable via Mountlist

    * THIS IS NOT A RAM DISK.  Operation will be necessarily slower
      than your HD, but that isn't the point behind using the device!

    * Advantages over RAD / Other ram disks ... doesn't use RAM.
      Designed for hard disk users.  By putting the 'partition'
      file on the hard disk, it sticks around and you don't loose
      the data you wrote to it, so mounting it again after reboot
      or power up yields whatever was there before.

    The fmsdisk.device simulates a trackdisk.device for fixed media
    via a DOS file (one file per unit).  Simply setup your Mountlist,
    mount the simulated trackdisk, and format, and you are off.

    This has particular advantages for those hard disk users who make
    lots of distributions, like me.  I can create a simulated partition
    using fmsdisk.device that uses exactly the same parameters as
    my favorite floppy device (and run the appropriate file system,
    in this case the OFS).  After formatting, I can copy the distribution
    onto the simulated partition and then DiskCopy it to the floppy.

    This also has advantages to people fooling around with writing their
    own file systems, as the disk file used may be examined at any time
    through normal programs while the 'filesystem' is running.

			   INSTALLATION

    copy fmsdisk.device devs:

    Assign FMS: to some empty directory on your hard disk (doesn't have
    to be empty, but might as well be clean, eh?).  Files will be
    named FMS:Unit%d

    Add appropriate entries to your Mountlist (see example Mountlist).

    Mount FF0:

    ; Only need to format the first time to create the file.
    Format drive FF0: name "FF0" NOICONS

    Repeat above two lines for each simulated partition you wish to add.
