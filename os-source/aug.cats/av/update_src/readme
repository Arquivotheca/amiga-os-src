This archive contains a few files which should bring the AV sources
zoo up to a version we think of as 2.5c (internal version 40.3)


These files fix a memory leak with HAM brushes.


NOTE - make sure that the previous sources (the zoo) incorporate
an MPEG SETBORDER color command - that was a late change added by
Wayne.
