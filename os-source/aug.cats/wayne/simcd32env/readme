SimCD32Env is a developer tool which enables developers to simulate
the envirnoment of the AmigaCD32 upon bootup. The simulated freeanim.library
included in this archive is required for SimCD32Env to function properly.
This library has an internal version string of 'SimFreeAnim 1.2', to avoid
confusion with the real library.

When SimCD32Env is run, a black screen is brought up to represent the
AmigaCD32's startup animation. Sprites are allocated and will appear
in the shape of a 'CD'. When your application calls 
OpenLibrary ( "freeanim.library" ), the 'CD' will move left off of the
screen and the screen will close. Then a call to CloseLibrary( freeanim.library),
will return immediately after the screen has been closed. This is similiar
to what happens under the real CD32 envirnoment.

The animation screen has the library opencount and closecount printed to
it to monitor your application's freeanim.library calls.

The 'CD' sprites are not tied to the screen's viewport. This was done so
that applications which neglect to free the startup animation, will have
these sprites show up on the display.

SimCD32Env takes an optional command line parameter, CDTV.TM. If present,
this switch tells SimCD32Env to simulate a CDTV envirnoment by NOT calling
SetChipRev( SETCHIPREV_AA ). If this keyword is NOT present, SimCD32Env calls
SetChipRev to put the system into AGA CD32 compatible mode.

One way to test your application using SimCD32Env and SimCD32 is to make a boot
floppy which starts SimCD32Env and SimCD32, mounts cd0:, assigns everything over
to cd0:, and then executes the cd0:s/startup-sequence.

The SimCDEnv.lha archive contains everything needed to do this. Just unarchive
this to a floppy and use the install command to make the floppy bootable. You
will need to edit the floppy's startup-sequence to point SimCD32 to the proper
path on your hard drive to the ISOimage you wish to use.
