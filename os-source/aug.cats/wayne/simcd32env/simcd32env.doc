   NAME
        SimCD32Env - A CD32 envirnoment simulator.

   SYNOPSIS
        SimCD32Env CDTV.TM/S:

   FUNCTION
        Simulate CD32 bootup envirnoment by opening up a fake startup animation.

   INPUTS
        CDTV.TM/S      - Optional keyword which tells SimCD32Env NOT to SetChipRev
                         into AGA mode.

   RESULTS
        When run, a screen will open which represents the CD32's startup animation.
        This screen will close down when an application opens and closes
        freeanim.library, similiar to what happens under the real CD32 envirnoment.

   NOTES
        The simulated freeanim.library included in this archive is required for
        SimCD32Env to function properly. This library has an internal version
        string of 'SimFreeAnim 1.2', to avoid confusion with the real library.
