TalkCD will allow you to talk directly to the audio drive
mechanism.  To send a command, simply type the bytes to be
sent in the "Send_To_Drive" window and press return.  The
index of the packet (first four bits) are calculated
automatically.  The checksum is also calculated
automatically when a "*" is entered.  The "*" is required
because that is how the program determines where the end of
the packet is.  Examples:

7 *                         (send ID packet)

4 0 2 0 1 20 0 0 0 0 4 0 *  (play from 00:02:00 to 01:20:00)

5 1 *                       (Turn on drive light)

5                 (same thing -- the * is the end of the
1                                packet, not the RETURN)
*

Warning:  If you turn on automatic Q-Code reporting while
doing a SETPLAY, the "Receive_From_Drive" window will
probably not be able to print the packets fast enough and
the buffer will wrap and the program will get out of sync. 
When this happens, the data you get back in the receive
buffer will not match the actual data the drive is sending
back.

Solution:  Don't do it.



Note to Philips:

The following command should send back a response:

05 81 *

the high bit of the second byte indicates that a response to
the packet is requested.  The drive does not respond.
