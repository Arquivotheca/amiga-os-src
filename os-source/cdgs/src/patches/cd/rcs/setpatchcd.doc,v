SetpatchCD fixes a CDXL interrupt problem.  If you plan on using CDXL
(i.e. you plan on using the CD_READXL command of the cd.device driver)
and you plan on installing an XL interrupt (i.e. filling in the IntCode
field of the CDXL structure), then you should use this setpatch program.

It will not hurt to run this program if you are not sure if CDXL is
being used with the software you are running.
