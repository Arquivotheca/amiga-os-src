Building a new MPEG rom requires an LMK release.  This causes
a bumprev to generate new VERSION and REVISION (as well as DATE)
which are required to build the VERSION and REVISION into the
autoconfig image (which is nibble wide data generated by
the assembler - see autoconfig.asm).

The resolved image, and symbol tables are then built in T:
where they can be copied to a release, or production build
directory on the server.
