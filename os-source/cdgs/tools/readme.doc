Larry Feldman and Chris Ludwig:

These are the latest versions of the programs.

ISOCD comes with CDTV.TM.  ISOCD will place the CDTV.TM file before the root
directory on the CD if it finds it in the current directory or in the
directories being examined.  This will make boot up time slightly faster
and removes the need for CDTV.TM to be everywhere.  ISOCD has a hook for
OptCD which will be explained later.

SimCD comes with the following:
   Devs/Local
         bookmark.device
         cdtv.device
   L/Local
         CDFS
   Libs/Local
         debox.library
         playerprefs.library
   BookFile
   FakIR
   SimCD

SimCD is complete with the exception of the multiple speeds.  I will like
to find out how you would like to implement this.  BookFile allows for more
than just loading a bookmark and cardmark.  FakIR is the program that
simulates the Infared Remote and special keys.

This is a list of some of the changes since the last versions sent to
Ben Phister:

ISOCD:
	- Added reverse byte fields for Intel style systems (default)
	- Added ";1" to file names (default)
	- Will create an additional path table for Intel (default)
	- Will not write to a volume controlled by cdtv.device (read only)
	- Source defaults to current directory
	- Small bugs fixed
	- Option to load layout file from shell
	- Option to automatically build (so entire operation could be
	  carried out from shell)
	- Diskchange after successful build (but not a diskchange of
	  any simulated volumes that might be affected - i.e. CD0:)
	- Build was not upper casing international characters properly
	- Fixed bug on saving layout file if failed to open (enforcer hits)
	- Interface changed to actually click on file names vs. button

SimCD:
	- Loading of settings was not turning options off, fixed.
	- BookMark/CardMark on/off logic was not entirely correct.
	- Interface changed to actually click on file names vs. button
	- Default settings file in S: now, instead of all over the place!
	- SimCD now allows you to re-enter the program while simulating
	  to change things that still can be changed.  This is a whole
	  lot more useful.
	- Reboot/Video/CD-DA options removed for now.

I will be supplying documentation for all of the programs soon and a
preliminary version of OptCD.  OptCD, with a special version of CDFS,
sits in the background and monitors CD access during running of a
developer's programs.  When enough information is collected, the developer
would chose Optimize under ISOCD to use this monitor file to optimize
a layout list.  Currently OptCD and the modified CDFS are finished as far
as collecting the information.  What remains is the modifications to ISOCD
to intelligently "optimize" a layout file.  I have included the current
OptCD and CDFS for comment.  Thanks for your patience in receiving this
material.
