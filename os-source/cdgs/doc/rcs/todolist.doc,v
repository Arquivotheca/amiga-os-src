    AmigaCD todo list

    [ ] means "todo", [x] means completed, [d] deferred
    [!] means denied (NOT).


Integration of Startup Animation (Martin):

[x] After-DOS module for language selection and high-scores
[x] Language selection window within animation
[x] Nonvolatile entry deletion window within animation
[x] locale.library should be modified for language selection
[d] Nonvolatile location prefs editor (computer module)
[d] Nonvolatile floppy disk maker
[x] Interlace mode preferences desirable for TV?  No.
[x] Consider TV/Monitor preferences / color ranges should be scaled
    down to avoid bleeding when a TV is used.  No time.

cd.device (Jerry):

[x] Multi-session support within device driver
[x] cd.device needs to be thoroughly tested
    (I've tested it about as much as I can)
[x] Drive error rate needs to be checked and addressed if necessary
    (works wonderfully as long as the chuck is chucked properly now)
[x] Downcode ECC to assembly and optimize if possible.
[x] Should frame interrupts be generated when paused?  No.
[x] Review functions documented as interrupt safe for compatability.
    (Note from Jerry: No commands are documented as interrupt safe
     and none of them are interrupt safe).
    (Note from Darren - INCORRECT, see cdtv:dev_cr.auto ADDCHANGEINT.
     CDTV_QUICKSTATUS, CDTV_REMCHANGEINT, CDTV_CHANGENUM, and
     CDTV_CHANGESTATE are documented as safe to call from with the
     ADDCHANGEINT interrupt (this is a level 1 Cause() interrupt) IF
     cdtv.device is calling cd.device equivalent functions which are
     not interrupt safe, then one or the other may need mods.
    (Note from Jerry again: - No, you're INCORRECT.  We are not
     talking about cdtv.device, this is cd.device.  See below for
     cdtv.device).
[x] Should READXL be given a List * or a Node * (?) List.
[x] See if I can correct for CHECKSUM ERROR hardware seems to generate.
    Done what I believe I can.
[x] When new hardware arrives, recode to detect errors on CDI formats

cdtv.device (Jerry):

[x] ReadXL of cdtv.device needs to be implemented (for 2 or 3 titles)
[x] CDTV_FRAMECALL function broken; also does not fully emulated CDTV
    device functionality of accepting a skip count.
[x] Does poking db_ReadAbortPlay still fix games which required this
    for implied Abort_IO of play on CMD_READ? (automatically!)
[x] How do we enable frame call interrupts when the disk is not playing
    like we had to do for some games which (like CDTV Classic) require
    frame call interrupts even when the disk is not playing?
    (Note from Jerry: interrupts should be generated all the time)
[x] PlayMSF conversion incorrectly converts IO_LENGTH (was actual
    time in cdtv.device) to length of play + 2 seconds when calling
    cd.device equivalent function.  See me for details - Darren.
[x] Document changes in interrupt safeness and functions not supported.
   (Note from Darren - The decision not to support CDTV titles which
    followed the very clear guidelines published for CDTV cannot be
    made arbitrarily.  I raised this issue more than once, and pointed
    out that this was likely to be a compatability problem.  I need
    a good technical reason as to why the interrupt safe commands cannot
    be supported.  Off hand, I see no technical reason why these commands
    cannot be supported by simply reading the status info directly out
    of cd.device base, and honoring the IOF_QUICK flag in cdtv.device.
    
cardmark/bookmark.device (Jerry)

[x] cardmark.device is not in build list (opened by some games) -
    must check if these games fail to run without it. (we will fake
    this driver to pretend to work if necessary)
    Which games use this?  I'm not aware of any.
    We will hear about this from a bug report if any titles bomb.
[x] cdtvprefs program is returning ERROR: CMD_READ failed - implies
    there is some incompatability with bookmark.device
    (This will not fail if booted as a CDTV title)

cdstrap (Jerry):

[x] Modify to send disk insert/false alarm messages to animation
[x] Test with kludges modules
[ ] Test boot from XIP cards.
[ ] Test credit card disks.
[ ] Test with IDE, multi-floppies, etc.
[x] Verify memory is not fragmented by cdstrap (was a real problem
    in CDTV-CR for a while).
[x] Replace picture with startup-animation
[x] Proper default screen centering should be involked here.
[x] Integrate language and nonvolatile locker modules.
[!] Investigate not adding playerprefs and other modules when not
    booting a CDTV title.  Not trivial, not worth the work.
[x] Talk to Randell about "Task Held" requester suppression

player modules (Jerry/Peter/Martin):

[ ] Thoroughly test and debug player program
    Some hanging bugs observed!
[ ] Graphical adjustments: use 128 colors, anti-alias button faces, use
    copper list for background gradient, add logo
[ ] Center screen properly
[ ] Minimize time until it's ready to play
[ ] Add a welcoming beep indicating when it's ready to play

[ ] Should review all functions for AA compatability
[ ] Some playerprefs.library functions sniff, and fast poke copper list colors
[x] Add CD+G support back into player
[x] AA support for player program
[x] Add game controller buttons to player
[x] Player program has Intuition pointer sprite present (why is
    Intuition being started?)  Screen flashes during start of player,
    Intuition pointer appears for a moment, etc.
[x] Player is not using CDGFastForward/Rewind/NextTrack/PrevTrack functions
[x] Player program colors off in enlightened modes - probably color poking
    routines
[x] Player confused if >99 minutes worth of entries are added to play list.
[x] Player hangs at times (cause unknown as of yet).  Front/Back to/from
    +G screen is working (implying its not hanging in CDGDraw()), player
    program is still color cycling, and it thinks the disk is playing,
    but its not .. hangs at some spot on the disk, junk out the serial
    port, etc. (hardware problem -- *** [ ] *** to be fixed)
[x] Trying to search while paused makes drive search (although interface
    acts properly)
[x] Player hangs/confused by starting PLAY, then pressing the track
    set/clear/reset gadget; play MAY stop, or player may lock up.  Pressing
    other gadgets don't work, and pressing the track set/clear/reset gadget
    again can cause it to lock such that you can't move the gadget selector
    at all
[x] Player program (I believe) uses color poker functions to do its
    color cycling
[x] Fix mouse support to be usable
[x] Add pre-repeat delay to joystick motion
[x] Fix randomness of shuffle play
[x] Countdown modes of timer should have a negative sign
[x] Enlarge the transport controller gadgets and unify play/pause
[x] Track counter should show total tracks when stopped
[x] Allow changing audio disks without it rebooting
[x] 4510 Player module calls AllocMem, and Waits inside of
    Expunge().  Also Expunge() code test for open count is
    inverted, causing it to try to terminate a task which was
    never started - system crashes during expunge.

CDFS (Randell):

[x] CDFS work (Disk insert/removal drops entries) - cleanup needed too
[x] Does CDFS generate read/write error requesters?  Should it?  No.


CD+G module (Darren):

[x] Do it.
[x] Think about enlightened mode (darren - needs a mod for 2x/4x fetch modes,
    but have no intent of rewriting to support extended +G this time)
    Works when enlightened; no support for CD+G Extended though (and
    no extended disks to test with)
[ ] Probably should disable CD+MIDI if no computer module installed since
    there is no serial port.

nonvolatile.library (Dave):

[x] nonvolatile.library should turn off file system requesters too
[x] add KillRequester paramters to GetCopyNV(), StoreNV(), etc.
[x] update DOCs per CATS request
[d] Add call to flush for disk operations.  Code now does an immediate Close().
[x] Verify platform is CDGS before accessing NVRAM device.
[x] Add internal structure recovery routine to NVRAM device (in case of
     power off while writing NVRAM device.)
[x] Change the system reserved data App/Item name to two NULL strings
[x] Add Martin's code review modifications.
[!] Modify the KillReq method in InitDisk so that lowlevel.library is not opened
     on open of Nonvolatile.library.
[x] Previous entry has been replaced by Jerry (CDstrap?) opening nonvolatile.
     library to get language setting instead of lowlevel.library.  This allows
     nonvolatile to open lowlevel once and use it for all kill/restore requesters.
     (lowlevel.library no longer opens nonvolatile in its open.)
[x] CI34 - Fix GetNVList bug when both disk and chip NVRAM exist
[x] CI35 - Fix DeleteNV bug when both disk and chip NVRAM exist
[x] CI38 - Remove outstanding 68020 only instructions.
[ ] Add conditionals to generate ROM and DISK version on nonvolatile.library

lowlevel.library (Jim):

[ ] Lack of a mouse is going to break CDTV titles.  Emulation needed?
[ ] Pointer blanking would be nice.  Perhaps necessary.  (design review)
[x] Setfunction EZRequest so SCON_KillReq can kill all system requesters.
[x] Add MikeS code to translate joystick/game controller to input events.
[ ] Add support in ReadJoyPort for the double controllers.
[ ] Add a message port to the device calls when changing the state of
    input.device, gameport.device and keyboard.device.
[ ] ReadJoyPort should only try to allocated the port 1 PotGo bits if
    it is to use the port.  It should also be possible to fail this
    allocation.


Kludges/Compatability (Darren/Testers)

[x] Kludges which enables sub-codes by poking CR hardware is unsafe.
    Require new mechanism for enabling frame call interrupts.
[x] Relies on getting a pointer to CDTV.device base - if changed
    to cd.device base, various mods required for kludges
[ ] Test all kludges
[ ] Add new kludges as needed
[!] Move cd.device DMA pages to HIGH memory to avoid conflicts with
    boot block games (better where they are)
[x] Kludges has been modified to open cd.device, but is still sending
    the CDTV_READ command (minor, but should be fixed).
[ ] CDTV Classic/CR generated CDTV specific keycodes for IR controller
    STOP, PLAY, PREV, NEXT, REW, FF.  At least one title was using
    these, and player programs will not be entirely usable even though
    similar functions are available via the game controller.

Drive Firmware (Chinon):

[x] Seeking to second session of a multi-session disk
[ ] Playing TOC does not always seem to work (Psygnosis).
[x] Short seeks do not seem to mute data output
[x] Cannot read last sector on disk (my fault)
[x] When doing a read after reading the TOC of a Hybrid (B0) disk,
    The drive immediately returns an error ($AB) and THEN does a seek
    to the requested sector (doesn't seem to do this anymore).
[x] Disk will spin backwards on eject (Jim believes this has been fixed)

Other modules:

[ ] Debox must handle AA (Richart)
[ ] Startup Animation (Jim Sachs)
[x] Exec mods for 1 meg ROM, ROM checksum
[x] Build tools for 1 Meg rom

Miscellaneous:

[x] Serious bitching needs to be done about a volume attenuator.
    We ain't gonna get it.
[ ] We will need a computer module for testing!
[ ] Update all libraries/devices to a version # of 40.x
[x] Should bootmenu be in the build list? Got a custom CDGS bootmenu
[ ] Test with 030/040 accelerators / CopyBack cache / Run with enforcer
[x] May need TV font for preferences
[ ] Remove beta alert from exec
[x] Make sure new disk.resource for trackdisk is in build list
[x] Research on screen centering.
[x] Avail FLUSH will kill the system.  One of the modules does not
    expunge properly.
