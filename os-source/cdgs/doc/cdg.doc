   CD+G

	CD+G is a standard format for encoding graphics data on
	audio CD's.  This data is stored with the audio data such
	that the graphics data retrieved is synchronized with the
	audio.

	CD+G currently defines a limited set of graphics operations
	including --

	o Setting border color (0..15)

	o Drawing a 6 bit wide, by 12 bit high graphic image
	  at a specific ROW/COLUMN position.  The graphic image
	  is drawn in 2 colors.  The pen colors to use are encoded
	  in the graphic data.

	  A 6x12 pixel element is known as a FONT.

	o Exclusive-OR a 6x12 bit graphic image with another.
	  EOR makes it possible to draw a graphic image, and
	  color it in more than 2 colors by EORing the previous
	  bit-pattern with a new one using 2 new pen colors.

	o Clear the entire display with a color (0..15).

	o Change the color table (0..15).  Separate CD+G instructions
	  are used to load pen colors 0-7, and 8-15.

	o Scroll screen left/right, up/down.  The vacated portion
	  is filled in with a pen color (0..15).  Smooth scrolling
	  is possible.

	o Scroll screen left/right, up/down.  The vacated portion
	  is filled in with the data which is scrolled off screen.

	There are currently two kinds of graphics --

	o Line Graphics - the display is a VISIBLE 2 rows, by
	  48 columns.  Each FONT element in the display is 6 pixels
	  wide by 12 pixels high.  This mode is currently NOT
	  supported.

	o TV Graphics - the display is a VISIBLE 16 rows, by
	  48 columns.  Each FONT element in the display is 6 pixels
	  wide by 12 pixels high.  This mode IS supported by
	  cdg.library.

   CHANNELS -

	Two of the CD+G drawing instructions can be divided into
	channel numbers.  These are the WRITE FONT intruction
	which draws a 2 color 6x12 image on the screen, and the EOR
	FONT instruction which uses EOR logic to draw over an existing
	font.

	The primary channel number is 0, and would typically be used
	to draw a picture.  Infact, some CD+G disks will only use
	channel 0.

	In addition to channel 0, there are 15 other channels which
	can be used for additional graphics imagery, such as the
	text for more than one language.

	By default the cdg.library uses channels 0, and 1 for
	graphic data.  The cdg.library also provides a function
	so that channels 2-15 can be used instead of channel
	1.  Therefore, two channels are always active.

	While the CD+G specification recommends that there be
	a mechanism for selectively turning on/off all 16 channels,
	it is also not entirely clear if, or how the data should
	be mixed on screen.

	Because there are already variations in CD+G implementations
	regarding channel selection, and usage, the scheme provided
	for in cdg.library is probably the least complicated for the
	user.  It is however admittedly not completely within the
	ideal specification.

   PACKS & PACKETS

	CD+G data is stored in something called a PACKET.  There
	are up to 4 TV GRAPHIC'S PACKS per PACKET.  Each PACK
	in a PACKET can be a separate graphics instruction from
	those listed above.

	Because a new PACKET is available 75x/second, CD+G requires
	most of the available CPU time on a 68000 based system to
	keep up with the data.

   ERROR CORRECTION

	Because of the nature of CD's, data can be munged.  Because
	audio data must be played in real-time, it is not possible
	to retry a bad block of data.  The CD standard includes
	an ERROR CORRECTION method which helps to minimize data loss.

	As of V39 of the cdg.library, Reed-Solomon error
	correction has been implemented in software.  While the current
	software implementation is quite efficient, a mechanism
	has been provided for disabling error correction.

	In the case of a 68000 Amiga-CD unit running a 7Mhz 68000,
	ERROR DETECTION requires approximately 550-600us per PACK.
	Correction of ONE error requires an additional 350-400us
	per PACK.  Correction of TWO errors requires an additional
	800-1000us per PACK.  Correction of more than two errors
	per PACK is not possible, and PACKS with more than two
	errors are discarded.

	If error correction has been disabled, all PACKS are processed
	as is.  However because the typical case is no errors, the
	additional 2 milliseconds per PACKET (4 PACKS) still makes it
	possible to leave approximately 50% of the available CPU time
	free when CD+G is running with error correction enabled.

	***NOTE***

		The CD+G/+MIDI module was originally designed for
		use on a 68000 based system.  Therefore timing
		is obviously improved on a 68020-68040 based system.

	In addition to the Reed-Solomon error correction, PACK
	data is 8x interleaved on disk.  Therefore even if 16
	bytes of contiguous data are munged by a scratch, or
	other imperfection, it is likely that all 16 bytes can
	be corrected.

	It is possible that in the future error correction may be
	implemented in hardware, in which case error correction might
	always be enabled.

	Even with error correction enabled, it is possible to have more
	than two errors per PACK, or to have so many errors that the
	error detection code cannot calculate the actual number of
	errors.

   cdg.library (V39)

	The cdg.library provides a set of functions for use with   
	Commodore Amiga CD systems.  These functions are meant to be
	used by the Player Preferences module which lets the user
	select audio tracks to play.  Note that these functions
	were not available in the initial cdg.library, and the V39
	functions are not compatable with the earlier version of
	the CDTV cdg.library.  It is also possible to write a custom
	player program which makes use of cdg.library to play CD+G, and
	CD+MIDI disks.

	***NOTE***

		The cdg.library was primarily designed for use with
		the audio disk player module, so does not use Intuition
		screens.  Infact the player module installs an input
		handler to lock-out Intuition.  Use of the cdg.library
		in an Intuition environment requires similar locking
		and use of cdg.library functions to manage screen
		ordering.  The primary reason for writing your own
		+G/+MIDI player would be for a Kaoroke player, or
		other multi-media environments in which the Intuition
		model does not apply well.

	The caller of cdg.library functions is responsible for managing
	user input, and CD activity, including selecting tracks to
	play, starting play, stopping play, etc.  These kinds of
	disk control functions are provided by the cd.device.

	In the typical case, the following steps are recommended -

	1.) Initialize a CDGPrefs structure.  This structure
	must be entirely filled in, and contains many pointers to
	sprite data which must be initialized.  CDGAllocPrefs()
	should be used to allocate the CDGPrefs structure.  Likewise
	use CDGFreePrefs() to free the structure.

	The sprites are used to display activity information to the
	user when the CD+G display is active.  An example would be
	a change in channel selection.  A new channel number is
	automatically displayed for a few moments for the user's
	benefit.  Sprites are also used to display disk activity
	such as PAUSE mode.
	
	Each image is composed of 4 sprites.  Two sprites are
	used for the left side of the symbol, and two for the
	right.  The image can use 8 colors because attached
	sprites are used.  Each symbol requires pointers to
	FOUR sprites arranged in this order -

		1st ptr -> Left side sprite
		2nd ptr -> Left side, attached sprite
		3rd ptr -> Right side sprite
		4th ptr -> Right side, attached sprite

	The ordering arrangement is designed to be convienent
	for the cdg.library, and provides enough colors to make
	attractive images.  Because sprites are used, the total width
	of each image is always 32 bits wide, and the height is
	variable.  It is highly recommended that the images not be
	more than 32 bits high to insure they fit on the screen, and
	avoid excessive memory usage.

	Sprite data should be in CHIP RAM, and be stored in the
	simple sprite format including space for the posctrl words, and
	NULL terminating words.  The height of all sprites must be
	the same.

	The CDGPrefs structure includes other fields defined in the
	cdgprefs.i/h file such as display position, and an array of
	8 colors to be used for the sprites.

	2.) Call CDGBegin() with the CDGPrefs() structure as an argument.
	This function starts the cdg.library.  The call may fail due to
	lack of memory, or inability to open a needed system resource.
	Of interest, the cdg.library will only process MIDI packets IF
	the serial port, and control bits have not been allocated by
	some other task (e.g., the serial.device).

	Once started, the cdg.library starts collecting PACKETS as
	available.  The PACKETS are buffered, but because of the
	rate and size of the PACKETS assume no more than 1 seconds
	worth of PACKET data will be buffered before it is overwritten
	by more recent PACKETS.

	3.) Call CDGPlay(), and start the CD playing.  Once the CD starts
	playing, assume the cdg.library is receiving CD+G PACKETS.  At this
	point your code should call CDGDraw() as often as possible.  During
	every call, CDGDraw() will process any pending PACKS.

	CDGDraw() also returns a value indicating if ANY CD+G, or CD+MIDI
	PACKS have been processed.  This is meant to be used as an indicator
	that the CD+G screen should be brought to front, or perhaps a gadget
	would be displayed indicating that CD+G is available.  The user will
	probably prefer the CD+G screen automatically coming to front, or they
	will miss the initial portion of the animation.

	To bring the CD+G screen to front, use the CDGFront() call.
	It is recommended that you first call CDGDraw() so that
	any pending PACKS will be processed before the screen is
	made visible.

	4.) The player program is now responsible for switching to
	CD+G mode by efficiently checking for user input, and regularly
	calling the CDGDraw() function.  The loop should be coded
	to provide maximum CPU time for CDGDraw().  A mechanism is
	provided so that Wait() can be used to sleep between calls.

	5.) If the user presses a key, or button indicating they want 
	to bring the Player program to front, you must use the CDGBack()
	function to tell CD+G to turn off any sprites it has on screen, and
	notify it not to bring its own screen to front again until CDGFront()
	is called.

	6.) The cdg.library provides a number of functions for
	telling it what the CD is doing, as well the ability to
	change the active channels 1-15.  These functions are also
	used to provide some visual indication to the user that their input
	has been noticed, and what is happening.  In addition to the channel
	selection, there are sprite images in CDGPrefs for the following
	modes --

		PLAY	- Image is displayed for a few moments.
			  Indicates the disk has started PLAY.
			  Should be displayed whenever the disk
			  starts playing, including after PAUSE,
			  STOP, FF, and REW.

		PAUSE	- Image is displayed indefinitely.

		STOP	- Image is displayed indefinitely.

		FF	- Image is displayed indefinitely.

		REW	- Image is displayed indefinitely.

		NEXT TRACK - Image is displayed for a few moments.
			     PLAY is implied.

		PREV TRACK - Image is displayed for a few moments.
			     PLAY is implied.

		CHANNEL    - Image is displayed for a few moments.

	See AutoDocs for the functions used to display these images.

	7.) If the CD is removed, the CDGDiskRemoved() function should
	be called.

	8.) To close down the cdg.library, use the CDGEnd() function
	to free all memory, and resources allocated by CDGBegin().

	Note that while your own screen is displayed, it is not
	necessary to call CDGDraw() once per PACKET, but it should
	still be called as often as possible of data may be lost.
	Assume no more than 1/2-3/4 seconds of PACKET data will be
	buffered before it is overwritten by new data.

	Note that sprite images can be replaced by a more recent
	sprite image if the image has not already been removed
	from the display.  For example, if the user is changing
	channel numbers, you can call CDGChannel() at any time,
	and the most recent channel will be displayed.

	If you call CDGBack() while a sprite image is being
	displayed, the sprite image is turned off at the next
	VBLANK.  The last sprite image is NOT automatically restored
	when you call CDGFront() again.  Therefore if the disk
	is still in PAUSE mode, you will probably want to call
	CDGPause() again after bring the CD+G screen to front.

    SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

	During FF and REW, CD+G data is missed.  Because data is
	missed, the CD+G display is cleared during these operations,
	and the display may not be properly updated.  For example, if
	the color tables were supposed to have been changed during the
	section of the CD which is skipped in FF/REW modes, the colors
	will be wrong when the disk starts to PLAY again.  Fortunately
	many CD+G titles refresh the colors regularly, but not all.  Some
	titles draw static images may not be updated for long sections of
	play.

	Because there is no work around for this problem, you can
	either disable FF/REW during CD+G, or allow the problem.
	Ideally CD+G instructions will contain enough repetative
	information that this will not be a significant problem.

	Another special problem is that some PACKS are missed when the
	CD is taken out of PAUSE mode, and placed in PLAY mode.  There is
	no good work around for this problem, and it is generally not
	too annoying.

    MIDI DATA

	CD's can also contain MIDI data.  The cdg.library optionally
	handles MIDI PACKETS during CDGDraw(), and sends this data
	at MIDI Baud rates out the serial port.  It is therefore important
	to call CDGDraw() often enough to avoid long delays between
	MIDI PACK handling.

	MIDI PACKS can contain 0-12 bytes per PACK.  Therefore it is
	possible to exceed the maximum transmission rate allowed by
	MIDI.  In actual use though designers of +MIDI disks are warned
	about this, and will typically send much less data than the
	maximum possible.  MIDI PACK data is stored in a serial output queue,
	and transmitted via TBE interrupts.  It is therefore possible to
	interleave +G, and +MIDI data such that new graphics are being drawn
	at the same time +MIDI data is being transmitted.

	CDGStop(), CDGPause(), CDGFastForward(), CDGRewind(),
	CDGNextTrack(), CDGPrevTrack(), and CDGDiskRemoved() will
	send a sequence of bytes to tell all midi channels to be
	quiet if any +MIDI data has been sent since the sequence
	was last sent.  This is done to avoid 'stuck' notes.

    SYNCHRONIZATION

	One of problems with CD+MIDI is synchronization of audio, and
	+MIDI data.  Depending on the subcode hardware implementation,
	software may receive subcodes a byte at a time, or a FRAME
	at a time.  Assuming the later, there is still the problem of
	synchronizing +MIDI data from a FRAME which has already	passed
	with audio which is currently being played.  When you add in
	software/hardware overhead/delays, only approximate
	synchronization can be expected.

	In actual use synchronization is not a significant problem;
	our audio perception is limited.  However if you fail to call
	CDGDraw() at regular intervals, the cdg.library may buffer
	the data, but audio synchronization could be audibly affected.

	The same problem is of course true for +G (though less
	significant).  There is another problem with +G though.  There
	is no synchronization between VBLANK rate, and scrolling effects
	in +G disks.  So a +G scroll command may look smooth on one
	system, but "jerk" slightly on another.  New PACKETS are
	received 75x per second, while VBLANK rate may be 60x or 50x
	per second.

	The cdg.library batches up color changes, and scroll commands for
	the next complete video frame (around VBLANK time).  This is done to
	so that each video frame has a stable/solid look, but means that a
	scroll command or color change command may have to wait as much
	as one complete video frame before being displayed.  For color
	changes this is not visually noticeable, but for smooth scrolling
	effects lack of synchronization can be seen.

	D0

	struct CDGPrefs *CDGAllocPrefs( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Used to allocate a CDGPrefs structure.  All fields are initialized
	to NULL.

	For future compatability, this function should be used to
	allocate a CDGPrefs structure for use with CDGBegin().

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	cdgprefs - pointer to CDGPrefs structure, or NULL if the
	memory could not be allocated.

   NAME
	CDGBack -- Called before you bring your own screen to front.
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGBack( VOID )


	VOID CDGBack( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tells CD+G you are going to bring your own screen in front
	of CD+G's screen.  This tells CD+G that it should not display
	any sprites, or bring its own screen to front.  The programmer
	must call CDGBegin() first - failure to do so will result in a
	crash.

cdg.library/CDGBegin                                     cdg.library/CDGBegin

   NAME
	CDGBegin -- Start the CD+G display system
   
   SYNOPSIS
	result = CDGBegin( CDGPrefs )
	D0                    A0

	BOOL CDGBegin( struct CDGPrefs * );

   FUNCTION
	Starts CD+G with given preferences.  You must call CDGFront()
	to bring the CD+G screen to front.  CD+G uses graphics.library
	functions, and is not meant to be used in an Intuition
	screen environment.

   INPUTS
	CDGPrefs -- pointer to a CDGPrefs structure.  The structure
	includes the following information -

		Sprite image data for CD+G Channel selection.

		Sprite image data for CD play, pause, etc.

		Sprite height, and color table.

		Top/Left edge corder of CD+G screen.

		Enable/Disable +G and/or +MIDI PACK processing.

		Enable/Disable error correction of PACKS.

		An optional task pointer, and signal mask to
		Signal() when a new PACKET is available.

   RETURNS
	TRUE if CD+G started.  FALSE indicates failure, most likely
	due to lack of memory, or inability to obtain some other
	resource (e.g, use of sprites 2-5, unable to open the cd.device,
	etc.)

   NOTES
	Once started, the CD+G library will start buffering CD+G PACKETS.
	These packets will be lost if you do not call CDGDraw() often
	enough.  The CD+G screen can be made visible by calling
	CDGFront().

   NAME
	CDGChannel -- Set active channel number for FONT data
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGChannel( channel )
			    D0

	VOID CDGChannel( ULONG );

   FUNCTION
	Tells the cdg.library to use a new channel.  Channel 0 is always
	displayed.  In addition, one of 15 other channels can also be
	displayed.  The selected channel number is automatically displayed
	on the CD+G screen for a reasonable amount of time (approximately
	2-3 seconds).

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the channel numbers.

   INPUTS
	channel - A number from 1-15.

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The caller is responsible for managing user input, including
	polling for some button press indicating that the user would
	like to increment, or set a new active channel.

   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGClearScreen( VOID )

	VOID CDGClearScreen( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	This function is used to reset the screen.  The screen, and
	border color(s) are reset to black.  The bitplanes are
	cleared.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
       The following functions automatically clear the CD+G screen --

		CDGFastForward()
		CDGRewind()
		CDGNextTrack()
		CDGPrevTrack()

	CDGPlay() does not automatically clear the screen, so you
	may wish to do so by calling this function.  In the case where
	the user is changing tracks, or position via Next Track,
	Previous Track, Fast Forward, or Rewind, there is no need to
	clear the screen since functions are already provided which
	do so.

   NAME
	CDGDiskRemoved -- Tell CD+G that the CD has been removed
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGDiskRemoved( VOID )

	VOID CDGDiskRemoved( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library  that the CD has been removed.  If a front
	panel VFD is available, the "+G", and/or "+MIDI" control panel
	lights are turned off (if they are already on).

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	If a front panel VFD is available, the cdg.library will turn
	on "+G" and/or "+MIDI" indicator lights if a +G/+MIDI PACK
	has been processed during CDGDraw().  There is currently
	no good way to determine of a disk is +G/+MIDI before a
	track has been played.

	If +MIDI data has been sent, this function will also cause
	a sequence of bytes to be transmitted out the serial/midi
	port telling all midi channels to be quiet.

cdg.library/CDGDraw                                       cdg.library/CDGDraw

   NAME
	CDGDraw -- Main CD+G PACKET handling routine
   
   SYNOPSIS
	flags=CDGDraw( types );
	D0		D0

	ULONG CDGDraw( ULONG );

   FUNCTION
	Process pending packets.  CDGDraw() must be called in
	a loop from an efficient, relatively high priority task.
	Failure to call this function often enough will result
	in CD+G data being lost.

	Currently this function must be called at least once every
	1/2 a second, but while the CD+G screen is in front, it
	should be called as frequently as possible.  Ideally it is
	called in a loop which does little more than check for
	user input, and use the cd.device to control disk play,
	stop, pause, etc.

	While a +MIDI disk is playing, your code should call this
	function at least 75x per second, or the +MIDI output may not be
	synchronized with the CD audio output.

   INPUTS
	types - Type(s) of data to process.  See cdgprefs.h/i
	for defined flags.  For example -

		CDGDraw((ULONG)CDGF_GRAPHICS|CDGF_MIDI);

	Processes +MIDI, and +G PACKS.

		CDGDraw((ULONG)CDGF_GRAPHICS);

	Processes +G PACKS only.

   RETURNS
	flags - A set of flags as defined in cdgprefs.h/i.  The
	flags are used by the caller to determine if any +G, or
	+MIDI PACKS have been processed.

   NOTES
	Currently this function knows how to process TVGRAPHICS
	PACKS, and MIDI PACKS.  MIDI PACKS causes data to be sent
	at MIDI baud rates via the serial port.

	It is also possible to use Wait() instead of calling this
	function in a pure busy loop.  This requires providing a
	pointer to a task structure, and signal mask in the CDGPrefs
	structure when you call CDGBegin().  Because your task
	will be signaled approximately 75 times per second, your
	code needs to be efficient.

	In addition, the calling task must be of a high enough
	priority to avoid long delays.  In the typical CDTV-LIKE
	application only one task is effectively running, so this may
	not be a significant problem.  Even short delays can result in
	rough animation which is undesirable.

	It is allowable to call this function a pure busy loop,
	and not wait for a signal.  This function will simply
	return if there are no PACKs to be processed.

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library that the disk is in the FF mode.

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The FF mode sprite(s) is displayed until CDGPlay() is called,
	CDGBack() is called, or some other cdg.library mode function
	is called. 

	If +MIDI data has been sent, this function will also cause
	a sequence of bytes to be transmitted out the serial/midi
	port telling all midi channels to be quiet.

   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGFreePrefs( cdgprefs )
			      A1

	VOID CDGFreePrefs( struct CDGPrefs * );

   FUNCTION
	Used to free a CDGPrefs structure allocated with CDGAllocPrefs().

	For future compatability, this function should be used to
	free a CDGPrefs structure.

   INPUTS
	cdgprefs - pointer to CDGPrefs structure allocated with
	CDGAllocPrefs().

   NAME
	CDGFront -- Bring CDG screen to front
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGFront( VOID )


	VOID CDGFront( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Brings CD+G screen to front.  Programmer must call CDGBegin()
	first - failure to do so will result in a crash.

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	Recommend calling CDGDraw() once before calling this function.
	This will cause the CD+G display to get up to date before
	its screen is brought to front.  Do not call this function
	in a busy loop; not needed.

	See CDGBack() which should be called before bringing your
	own screen to front.

cdg.library/CDGNextTrack                             cdg.library/CDGNextTrack

   NAME
	CDGNextTrack -- Tell CD+G that the disk is in NEXT TRACK mode
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGNextTrack( VOID )

	VOID CDGNextTrack( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library that the disk is in the NEXT TRACK mode.
	The screen is cleared, and all colors are reset to black.

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The NEXT TRACK mode sprite(s) is automatically turned off after
	a few moments (e.g., 1/2 second), or when CDGBack() is called.

	CDGNextTrack() is much like CDGPlay(), except a different
	sprite is displayed, and the screen is automatically cleared.

	If +MIDI data has been sent, this function will also cause
	a sequence of bytes to be transmitted out the serial/midi
	port telling all midi channels to be quiet.

   NAME
	CDGPause -- Tell CD+G that the disk is in PAUSE mode
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGPause( VOID )

	VOID CDGPause( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library that the disk is in PAUSE mode.

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The PAUSE mode sprite(s) is displayed until CDGPlay() is called,
	CDGBack() is called, or some other cdg.library mode function
	is called. 

	If +MIDI data has been sent, this function will also cause

   NAME
	CDGPlay -- Tell CD+G that the disk is in PLAY mode
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGPlay( Show )
	               D0

	VOID CDGPlay( BOOL );

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library that the disk is in PLAY mode.  You must call
	this function each time you start the CD playing to enable
	subcodes (R through W).  Note that enabling means that
	the cdg.library does not ignore subcode interrupts, however
	subcode interrupts must still be enabled by the cd.device
	driver.
	
	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	Show -- If TRUE, the PLAY sprite is displayed on the
	CD+G screen for a few moments.

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The PLAY mode sprite(s) is automatically turned off after
	a few moments (e.g., 1/2 second), or when CDGBack() is called.

	During FF or REW, it probably makes more sense to call this
	function with a FALSE value for 'Show' since PLAY is implied
	after a FF or REW.

   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGPrevTrack( VOID )

	VOID CDGPrevTrack( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library that the disk is in the PREV TRACK mode.
	The screen is cleared, and all colors are reset to black.

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The PREV TRACK mode sprite(s) is automatically turned off after
	a few moments (e.g., 1/2 second), or when CDGBack() is called.

	CDGPrevTrack() is much like CDGPlay(), except a different
	sprite is displayed, and the screen is automatically cleared.

	If +MIDI data has been sent, this function will also cause
	a sequence of bytes to be transmitted out the serial/midi
	port telling all midi channels to be quiet.

   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGRewind( VOID )

	VOID CDGRewind( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tell CD+G that the disk is in the REW mode.

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The REW mode sprite(s) is displayed until CDGPlay() is called,
	CDGBack() is called, or some other cdg.library mode function
	is called. 

	If +MIDI data has been sent, this function will also cause
	a sequence of bytes to be transmitted out the serial/midi
	port telling all midi channels to be quiet.

   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGStop( VOID )

	VOID CDGStop( VOID );

   FUNCTION
	Tell the cdg.library that the disk is in STOP mode.

	Sprites, passed in a CDGPrefs structure at CDGBegin()
	time, are used to display the mode.

   INPUTS
	N/A

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NOTES
	The STOP mode sprite(s) is displayed until CDGPlay() is called,
	CDGBack() is called, or some other cdg.library mode function
	is called.

   NAME
	CDGUserPack -- Call cdg.library with your own PACK data
   
   SYNOPSIS
	VOID CDGUserPack( pack );
	                   A0

	VOID CDGUserPack( UBYTE * );

   FUNCTION
	This function is meant for those who want to draw their
	own graphics on the CD+G screen, or send a custom sequence
	of MIDI bytes.

	In general it is meant to be used when a CD+G disk, or
	CD+MIDI disk is not playing.  However given a custom
	CD+G disk, it is possible to mix real-time CD+G images
	with software generated images on the same screen.

   INPUTS
	pack - Pointer to PACK data.  Each symbol in a PACK
	consists of 6 bits, otherwise known as channels P
	through W.

	The P and Q channel bits MUST be 0.  The Q0-Q1 parity
	bytes, and P0-P3 parity bytes are ignored because it
	is assumed that the PACK you pass to this function is
	free of bit errors.  Because no error correction is needed,
	it is possible to draw at a much faster rate than is normally
	possible with real-time data from a disk.

   RETURNS
	N/A

   NAME
	OpenLibrary -- Open the cdg.library
   
   SYNOPSIS
	cdgbase = OpenLibrary(libName, version )
	D0                    A0       D0

	struct Library *OpenLibrary( STRPTR, ULONG );

   FUNCTION
	Returns pointer to library base if the library has not been
	previously opened.  Because of limited hardware resources
	(e.g., sprites, and CPU bandwidth) only one CD+G display
	is currently feasable.

	Therefore this OpenLibrary() of "cdg.library" returns a
	pointer to the library base only if some other task has not
	already opened it.
	
	You must call CDGBegin() with a CDGPrefs structure to actually
	start CD+G.

   INPUTS
	libName - pointer to string "cdg.library".

	version - Minimum version number requested should be 38.

   RETURNS
	Library base pointer, or NULL indicating the library is in use
	or not available.

   NOTES
	Prior to V39 of this library, there were no public library
	functions.  V39 provides many new public functions, and is
	not compatable with the CDTV version of cdg.library.
