Booting rules for cd1200:

NO DISK IS PRESENT:

1 If no disk is present, the startup animation is started.

A BOOTABLE DISK IS PRESENT:

2 If a bootable disk is present the disk will be booted (unless condition 5 is satisfied), the startup-
  animation is only started if the disk is a CD32 disk, and in this case, it only brings up the
  "Amiga CD32" boot-anim screen.  This screen is brought down by the application's openning and
  closing of the freeanim.library.

A BOOTABLE DISK IS INSERTED:

3 If at the startup animation a disk is inserted, and the disk is a CD32 disk, the "Amiga CD32"
  screen will replace the startup-animation and begin booting.  If any other bootable disk is inserted,
  the screen will fade and the system will reboot (to kick out of AGA mode).  Conditions for item 2 are
  now followed.

AN AUDIO DISK IS PRESENT:

4 If an audio disk is present, and no other boot device is present, the CDPlayer program is run.
5 If an audio disk is present, and a bootable disk is present, and the "boot audio" flag is
  set in nonvolatle RAM, then the CDPlayer is run.
6 If an audio disk is present, and a bootable disk is present, and the "boot audio" flag is
  clear in nonvolatle RAM, then the bootable disk is booted.

FAST RAM REMOVAL:

7 All fast RAM is removed from the system just before openning CDUI to start the startup-animation
  or "Amiga CD32" screen.  Since CDUI is only started on CD32 disks, fast RAM is only removed when
  booting CD32 disks.

LEFT AND RIGHT MOUSE BUTTONS:

8 If the left (RED) button is pressed before or during the startup animation, the NV editor is run.
9 If the right (BLUE) button is pressed before or during the startup animation, the language selector is run.

TRACKDISK AND IDE DEVICE DRIVER REMOVAL:

10 trackdisk.device and any other bootable devices are only removed when booting a CD32 title.
11 trackdisk.device is only removed if there are no readable floppy disks present in any drive.

SCREEN CENTERING:

12 The screen is centered only when booting a CD32 title.  It is not centered when booting any other
   bootable disk.

DOUBLE SPEED:

13 Double-speed is enabled when not booting off of the CD.

REQUEST ZAPPER:

14 Requesters remain disabled when booting off of a CD32 disk.
