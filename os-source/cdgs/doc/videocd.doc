   FUNCTION
	FreeVideoCDInfo() frees any system resources allocated by
	GetVideoCDInfo().

   INPUTS
	info - pointer obtained from GetVideoCDInfo(), or NULL

   NAME
	GetVideoCDInfoA -- Obtain information on a VideoCD standard disc.

   SYNOPSIS
	info = GetVideoCDInfoA (handle, sequenceNumber, options);
	D0		        A0      D0              A1

	struct TagItem *GetVideoCDInfoA(APTR, ULONG, struct TagItem *);

	info = GetVideoCDInfo(handle,sequenceNumber,firstTag,...);

	struct TagItem *GetVideoCDInfoA(APTR, ULONG, Tag, ...);

   FUNCTION
	Obtain information on a Karaoke 1.0 or VideoCD 1.1 standard disc.

	Information returned by this function falls into two general
	categories: disk-level and sequence-level. Disk-level information
	concerns describes the VideoCD as a whole, such as the
	title of the disk. To obtain this information, you supply a sequence
	number of 0. Sequence-level information describes an individual
	sequence on a VideoCD. This information is obtained by providing
	the sequence number corresponding to the sequence of interest.

	The information is returned in the form of a tag list. Many
	pieces of information stored on a VideoCD are optional. When
	the information is not present, the associated tag will not
	appear in the resulting tag list.

   INPUTS
	handle - Pointer to a handle obtained by GetCDHandleA().

	attrs - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra
	    parameters, or NULL

   TAGS
	GVCD_CodeSet (ULONG) - Preferred code set for returned strings.
	    The value supplied here comes from the VideoCD spec.  The default
	    is ISO 646.

	    VCCS_ISO_646
	    VCCS_ISO_8859_1
	    VCCS_JIS -- JIS Roman [14] & JIS Kanji 1990 (168)
	    VCCS_SHIFT_JIS -- Shifted JIS Kanji, including JIS Roman [14]
		and JIS Katakana [13]

	GVCD_GetCodeSets (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE to obtain a list of the
	    available character sets.  This will cause the following tags to
	    be returned when the disc is Karaoke:

	    GVCD_NumCodeSets (ULONG) -- Number of code sets.
	    GVCD_CodeSets (struct MinList *) -- Pointer to a list of
		CodeSetNode structures describing the available code sets.

   RESULT
	info (struct TagItem *) -- A pointer to a tag list containing one
	    tag for every piece of information obtained from the Video CD.
	    This pointer will be NULL if an error occurred.

   RESULT TAGS
	The following tags are returned only when the sequence number is
	0 and the disc contains Karaoke 1.0 information.

	    GVCD_DiscTitle -- title of the disc.
	    GVCD_DiscCatalogNum -- catalog number for disc.
	    GVCD_DiscNumSequences -- number of sequences on the disc.
	    GVCD_DiscDescription -- description of the disc.

	The following tags are returned only when the sequence number is
	0 and the disc contains VideoCD 1.1 information.

	    GVCD_InfoVersion -- INFO.VCD version.
	    GVCD_InfoAlbumID -- Album Identification.
	    GVCD_InfoNumberVolumes -- Number of discs in set.
	    GVCD_InfoVolumeNumber -- Volume number of this disc.
	    GVCD_DiscNumSequences -- Number of video tracks.

	The following tags are returned only when the sequence number is
	greater than 0 and the disc contains VideoCD information.

	    GVCD_EntriesUsed -- Number of chapter marks for this sequence.
	    GVCD_EntriesArray -- Array of chapter marks in LSN format.

	The following tags are returned only when the sequence number is
	greater than 0 and the disc contains Karaoke information.

	    GVCD_SequenceStartSector - Starting LSN of the sequence.
	    GVCD_SequenceEndSector - Ending LSN of the sequence.

	The following tags are returned only when the sequence number is
	greater than 0 and the disc contains Karaoke information and
	the tag was specified in the attrs input.

	    GVCD_SequenceISRCCode
	    GVCD_SequenceTitle -- title of current sequence
	    GVCD_SequenceTitleSort -- title of sequence for sorting
	    GVCD_SequencePerformer
	    GVCD_SequencePerformerSort
	    GVCD_SequenceWriter
	    GVCD_SequenceComposer
	    GVCD_SequenceArranger
	    GVCD_SequencePlayer
	    GVCD_SequenceTextHeader
	    GVCD_SequenceText -- Exec list of CDTextNode structures
	    GVCD_SequenceKareokiKey
	    GVCD_SequenceOriginalKey
	    GVCD_SequenceDescription -- Exec list of CDTextNode structures

	The following tags can always be returned, regardless of the sequence
	number requested.

	    GVCD_CodeSet -- Code set of strings returned
