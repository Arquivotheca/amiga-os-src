	Jim -

	This disk contains everything you should need to build your test
code into a CDGS eprom.  This setup will make a partial ROM build (minus
most CDGS modules) including your test program, and will load your test
program into ram and run it.  I'm assuming you have SAS/C 6.0 or better.

	The build tools are in the "build" directory.  Make sure they're in
your path before starting.  Copy the entire contents of the disk to
a directory on your HD.

	Take your program, and put it in the file chinon_test.  All you should
have to do then is "smake".  The makefile builds all the special tools,
takes chinon_test and turns it into assembler source (in test_code.asm),
and then assembles load.asm to build the test.ld module.  It then builds
a kickstart image.  This image can be burnt directly into a 1MB EPROM (it's a
binary rom image). The image is named kick.CDGS.99.1.

	When test.ld executes (right before the normal bootmenu time), it
will load your program into ram and jump to it.  Any normal executable will
work, but you must be careful not to try to use dos.library (which most
standard startup code does).  You can open Intuition, graphics, etc.

	Since your program is loaded into ram, you don't have to worry about
any ROMing issues.

	There's a trivial example of a test program included: test_prog.
That merely opens a screen and prints "Hi There".  To test you rom-building
ability, copy test_prog to chinon_test and do a build.

	I left nonvolatile and lowlevel in the build.  These are the CDGS
modules that deal with the game controller, or you could just use a mouse
with intuition/gadtools/etc (which is probably easier).

	For information on how to use the keyboard lines to input your error
data, ask Darren Greenwald (darren@cbmvax.cbm.commodore.com) if you can't
figure it out from the hardware and devices manuals.

	If you have any questions feel free to ask us.  I hope this is useful
to you.

p.s.  Actually, you need to type "smake maketest" to build one of the tools
before you make a kickstart image.  I'd change the makefile to fix that, but
I've already given the disks to Eric.
