Since the project is reaching its final days I am going to put a summery of any
changes in this file.

NOTES FOR 3/17/93

	[]	Use DeboxROM.library for building the Rom. This code has the special
		ROM tag and does not try to expunge itself.

	[]	New Debox.library version 39.2

	[]	Fixed bug in Debox.library -- MungWall hit.  in DecompBitMap on certain 
		pictures.
	
	[]	Changed Version sting date from (month.day.1993) to (month.day.93)
	
	[]	Made into a Library with one function StartAnimation  Library is currently
		called 'title.library'  It could easyly be remamed.  See Version.i
	
	[]	Fixed some visual bugs. Mainly the 32 flashing white.

NOTES FOR 3/18/93

	[]	Added a memory freeing scheme.   If memory runs low  the program 
		will automaticly shutdown.  This uses AddMemHandler().  See top of
		title.c for code.
	
	[]	Deallocate Much of the memory when the ANIMMSG_BOOTING is passed.
	
	[]	Fixed some more display bugs.
	
	[]	Worked on sound. However I'm having a lot of trouble with the audio.device
		I might need to go with a different scheme.   Will have it in by tomarrow
		by Hook or by Crook.
		
	[]	All of the display code is pretty much locked in.  I have a scripting 
		language that we can make changes to the apperance without any real 
		changes to the code.
		

	[]	The stand alone 'Title' program should now be run, use Tester to operate
		the demo.  Tester will work if either the 'title' or 'title.library' is 
		running.
