Hopefully you will be able to compile this with the Include: set to the 
amiga 3.0 include files.  The include directory under Title contains any 
other files that were not included in that release.

The tools directory (Under Title) contains the tools nessary to make the .o files

All the files for Debox.library are in the Debox directory.

Changes include:

	The Disc has been spead up and improved so that it doesn't look as jerky.
	I had to pull a lot of tricks to make that one work.

	Closer to what the final animation is.
	
	Other various things that I can't remember right at the moment.
	

There will be more changes made later today.  (Warp Stars, Other Color cycling, 
and things that Jim wants done.)   I will notify you of updates available for
downloading.


You will probably have questions...  Please call me with any.  I'm too tired to 
write any more.
