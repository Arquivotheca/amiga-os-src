;Release a network program/library.  Takes as an argument the ProgramName
;to release and a make program (defaults to 'make', but you might want 'lmk').
;Your makefile (or lmkfile) must have as targets at least: ProgramName,
;'bump' and 'release.'  You must be using 'col' to get locks on any files
;which you edit.
;
;If you get an error during a make, you will want to unlock the
;ProgramName_rev files.  You can do so with "rcs -u ProgramName_rev.XXX"
