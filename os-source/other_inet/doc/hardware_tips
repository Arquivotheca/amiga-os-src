                           THIN ETHERNET
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   A popular type of ethernet cable is often called "thin ethernet".
   It involves 50 ohm cable that is about 5 mm in diameter, with BNC
   connectors.  Note: There are several types of cable that meet this
   description.  Have your system manager verify that it is the correct
   type.  If you are using the common "thin ethernet", the following
   applies:

CABLES NOT CONNECTED PROPERLY

   Is the tee firmly connected to your ethernet card?

   The tee should swivel but not pull off when pulled gently.  If it
   pulls off, twist the collar a quarter turn clockwise until it pops
   into place.  The cables and terminator caps also have collars that
   pop into place after a quarter turn clockwise.

   You CANNOT connect the cable directly to your ethernet card.
   You must plug the middle-branch of a TEE into the Amiga, and the
   cable to one end-branch.  The other end-branch must be connected
   to a 50 ohm TERMINATOR cap, or to another cable.
   
   If your Amiga is the last machine on the end of the cable, you MUST
   connect a TERMINTOR CAP on the other end of the tee, as shown below:

   ethernet cable here--->  =========]   <---terminator cap here
                                H
                                H
                                H
                             Tee-middle
                          to ethernet card
                                



   If your Amiga is in the middle of a chain, there will be a cable
   on each end of the tee that has its middle branch connected to your
   Amiga, as shown below:

   ethernet cable here--->  =========   <---another ethernet cable
                                H
                                H
                                H
                             Tee-middle
                          to ethernet card


COMMUNICATION FAILURE OF ALL MACHINES ON THE CHAIN WILL RESULT FROM ANY OF:

1. Cable connected to ethernet card.  (Card connects to tee-middle only.)
2. Cable end open.                    (Cable end must connect to tee-end.)
3. Tee with one tee-end open.         (Tee-ends connect to cap or cables.)
4. Improper terminator.               (Must use 50 ohm ethernet terminator)

   If only the middle of the tee is disconnected from an ethernet card, it
   affects only that card; the rest of the network will be unaffected.


   Note: For devices other than computer ethernet cards, see system manager.

                           THICK ETHERNET
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


   The cable that connects the thick ethernet wire to your Amiga is
   about 12 mm in diameter, with 15 pin D-shell connectors.
   Note:  There are several types of cable that meet this description,
   so have your system manager verify that it is the right type.
   
   This type of cable connects directly to the female 15 pin connector in
   the end of the ethernet card in the Amiga.  For connections at the
   other end of the thick ethernet cable, see your system manager.
   
   Is the cable firmly connected to your ethernet card?


CARD MUST BE CONFIGURED FOR THICK ETHERNET

   The Commodore Ethernet card is shipped a jumper in position for
   thin ethernet.  To use thick ethernet, you must:

1. Disconnect power and other cables from the Amiga.

2. Open the Amiga's cover.

3. Remove ethernet card from the Amiga.

4. Locate the 18-pin jumper block on the ethernet card.
   It is next to the 15-pin female D-shell connector.

5. Remove jumpers from pin rows A&B (THIN ethernet position)
   Replace jumpers on pin rows B&C (THICK ethernet position)

6. Replace ethernet card in the Amiga.

7. Replace the Amiga's cover.

8. Reconnect power and other cables.
