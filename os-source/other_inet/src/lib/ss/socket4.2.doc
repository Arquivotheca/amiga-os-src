socket.library 4.2 release notes
--------------------------------

The main change from socket 4.0 to 4.2 is the addition of DNS.  You can now
use a DNS name server if one is available to you.

To turn on DNS, you must do the following:

1. Add the line 'usedns=true' to your inet:s/inet.config file.  This tells
   socket.library that you wish to use DNS.

2. Create a file called resolv.conf and place it in inet:db/.  This file is
   used to configure the DNS software.  See below for the format of this
   file.

3. Install the new socket.library inet:libs/.

That's it!

Well, almost.  You will probably need to modify your inet:db/hosts.equiv
file so that all hosts listed have fully qualified names, otherwise you
won't be able to use rsh into your amiga, or be able to use rcp from a
remote machine.  Example:

Old inet:db/hosts.equiv file:
----------------------------

cbmvax
ren
stimpy
itchy
scratchy
tsx
...


New inet:db/hosts.equiv file:
-----------------------------

cbmvax.commodore.com
ren.commodore.com
stimpy.commodore.com
itchy.commodore.com
scratchy.commodore.com
tsx.commodore.com
...


How to set up inet:db/resolv.conf
--------------------------------

The format of this file is similar to that of inet:s/inet.config, but without
the '=' symbols.  There are three keywords that are used:

nameserver nameserver-ip-address

domain your-domain-name

search domain-to-search domain-to-search ...

The nameserver line is used to set the IP address of the nameserver that you
would like to use.  You may specify up to three nameservers in the order that
they should be used.

The domain line is used to set the domain name of your machine, such as
'commodore.com', 'mtu.edu', etc.

The search line is used to set a number of domain's to append to hostnames
that are specified without any dots in them.

An example inet:db/resolv.conf file might be:

nameserver 135.7.10.1
domain commodore.com
search commodore.com siberia.commodore.com



GOTCHAS
-------

Unfortunately, since Commodore isn't directly connected to the Internet, you
may run into problems with the DNS stuff.   If you do, *please* send mail
to networking@cbmvax.commodore.com, or post a message in the amiga.beta/inet
group on BIX.  I've used the DNS client with a Unix machine here at Commodore
at it seemed to work ok for me, but it needs heavier testing than I can do
from here.
