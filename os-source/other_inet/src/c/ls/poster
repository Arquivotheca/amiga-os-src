LS 3.1 - The improved DIR/LIST command that keeps getting better!

  Dedicated to the many nice folks who have encouraged my
efforts, this is part of my continuing FreeWare contribution to
the Amiga community.  Since version 2.2, I have more than
doubled the number of features and made many internal
improvements.  Version 3.1 fixes a nasty command line bug in
3.0, and adds two new options to set the page width and height.
The LS 3.1 executable is still only 9704 bytes long, and can be
made resident.

Brief Summary of Changes from 2.2 to 3.0

 o "Instant" output sorting, regardless of number of entries.
 o New short listing is row-by-row, redirects to PRT: or file.
 o Improved dynamic columnizing, uses best-fit optimization.
 o Custom formatted output, ala LFORMAT, for easy script creation.
 o Plus much much more!

Changes From 3.0 to 3.1
 o Fixed random errors from uninitialized argument count in _main().
 o New -X and -Y options to specify short format columns and rows.

         Please see LS31SRC.zoo for the PD source code.
This ZOO archive contains the LS 3.1 executable and documentation only.

   Source Code Only for LS 3.1 - See LS31.zoo for executable.

  This is the Lattice 5.02 source code for LS 3.1.  This is
a hybrid C/ASM program.  I use CAPE to assemble, but the Lattice
ASM assembler will work.  Should port to Manx without difficulty.
Please see LS31.zoo for more details.
