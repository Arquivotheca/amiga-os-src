  I have included the object files "lssup.o" and "mycres.o" preassembled
using CAPE 2.5.  You can assemble these files using ASM, but the final
executable will grow by about 200 bytes!

  The makefile is designed to work with either LMK or PDMake,
and assumes that you are using CAPE as your assembler.  You
should change the AFLAGS line in order to use a different
assembler.  Also, my assembly header file directory is
referenced by the assignment "AINC:"; you should either make
this assignment on your system or modify the makefile to specify
a different directory.  The module "mycres.a" will need the
standard assembly headers to assemble.

     Good Luck,
       Justin
