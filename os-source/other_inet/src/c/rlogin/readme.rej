	NOTE: rlogin appears to have been under active modification when
BJ stopped working on it and/or was laid off.  getprefs.c was partially
modified and would not compile.  I made the "obvious" changes to make it 
compile.  The rlogin I built works, and is newer than the latest released
to the server (which was V38.0 and had debug code in it - it exits if you
type a 'Q'...)  However, I don't know how much of BJ's new preferences
code is actually finished/hooked up/missing.  The V38.0 rlogin on the
server is dated April 7th, 1993.  This code appears to be from late May,
1993.

	The old V37 rlogin is in rlogin.v37.

	All of BJ's test/etc directories are here.  I haven't figured out
exactly what they all are.

	Caveat programmer.
