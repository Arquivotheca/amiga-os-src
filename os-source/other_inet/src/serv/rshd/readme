Mount  38.21
------------

If you are using 2.04 then you will need this new "mount" command in your
C: directory if you want to update the pipe: entry in your mountlist as
per the docs.  The 2.04 mount will choke 'Device =' line.  Any mount
command later than the V37 release version should work fine.
