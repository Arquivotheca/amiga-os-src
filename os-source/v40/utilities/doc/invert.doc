	C function trace utilities.

    Installed in $V/utilities:
	calls - create C function call tree 
	    Answer's the question "who does this function call?"
	invert - invert output of 'calls' (must be tab-expanded first)
	    Answer's the question "who calls this function?"
    
    The latter is more useful.

    The way I use it is:

    In Makefile:

	iflow: $(CFILES)
	    calls -w256 -I$(SYSINCL) $(CFILES) | expand > iflow
    
    C-Shell alias:

	alias iwho invert \< iflow

    then 
	iwho <functionname>

    This note is invert.doc.  See also calls.doc for original
    docs on that function.
