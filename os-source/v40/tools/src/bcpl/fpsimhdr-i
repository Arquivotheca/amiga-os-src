*        MC68000           One of these is set
*        MC68010
*
*        COMP              Set if FPSIM for the compiler
*
* Also for the TOS version there is an additional flag COMP which is defined
* if FPSIM is being assembler for the compiler and is not defined if it is
* for the library. This is done via a header file (see TOS pascal makefile).
* The reason for this is that the library requires XDEFs whereas the compiler
* doesnt (and blink will complain if they are found)
