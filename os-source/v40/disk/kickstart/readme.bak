This directory is for kickstart builds and files related to the kickstart.

Note that this file is under RCS and if anyone changes items here on the
server it should be updated.  Also note that other files are under RCS.
Please make sure that if you wish to change them that you *first* check them
out locked and then change them and the check them back in.  (And post a
release note telling of what happened.)

Note that the tools for dealing with the builds is in the directory
structure:  HOG:Other/build with HOG:Other/build/bin containing the
Amiga executables.  (All of the build process runs on the Amiga)

Anyway, the directory structure should look something like this:

V:disk/kickstart/RCS		- The RCS directory for this file (and others)
V:disk/kickstart/buildlists	- directory containing build lists...
V:disk/kickstart/buildlists/RCS	- directory containing build lists RCS...
V:disk/kickstart/builds		- kickstart builds are here...
V:disk/kickstart/ReleaseBuilds	- public/developer releases go here...

--------

This directory (V:disk/kickstart) should contain a number of Amiga and/or
UNIX scripts to move builds around, purge builds, make builds, etc.
These scripts will require that the HOG:Other/build/bin directory
is in your path.

One important file in this directory is the build number.  The file
is V:disk/kickstart/BuildNumber.  This build number contains the
revision of the build.  DoBuild (the build master) will maintain
this file with the AUTOREV option.

The AmigaDOS scripts KillBuild and ReleaseBuild are in this directory.

KillBuild VERSION/A REVISION/A will delete all the files related to
the build of that version.revision.

ReleaseBuild VERSION/A REVISION/A will move the build files to the
ReleaseBuilds directory.

--------

The directory V:disk/kickstart/buildlists shoud contain the build lists for
the builds.  These build lists are under RCS (and thus the RCS directory)

--------

The directory V:disk/kickstart/builds contains all of the internal
released builds.  These builds have a file name format of:

	kick.<buildtype>.<version>.<revision>
	log.<buildtype>.<version>.<revision>
	sym.<buildtype>.<version>.<revision>.map
	sym.<buildtype>.<version>.<revision>.ld

The kick file is the actual binary file of the kickstart.  It is a absolute
binary and does not contain load information.  In the case of the A3000
builds, it is a file that if saved in DEVS:kickstart will work as a kickstart.

The log file is the log of modules, dates, and times of the build.

The sym files are WACK compatible symbol files for the build.  These can
be loaded into the LoadSym and CheckSym will be able to investigate
the symbols.

--------

The directory V:disk/kickstart/ReleaseBuilds contains all of the external
(mass developer) releases.  When a release happens, the builds that correspond
to this release should be moved from the builds directory and placed into the
ReleaseBuilds directory.  If one wishes, a symbolic relative link can be set
up between the two.  (Use the UNIX ln command)

The file name structure is the same as the builds directory.

--------

The build directory structures should continue to be documented in this
file.  Any other general information should also be documented in this file.
