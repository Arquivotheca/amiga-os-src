@******* amiga.lib/CallHook ***************************************************
*
*   NAME
*	CallHook -- Invoke a hook given a message on the stack.
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	result = CallHook( hookPtr, obj, ... )
*
*	ULONG CallHook( struct Hook *, Object *, ... );
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Like CallHookA(), CallHook() invoke a hook on the supplied
*	hook-specific data (an "object") and a parameter packet ("message").
*	However, CallHook() allows you to build the message on your stack.
*
*   INPUTS
*	hookPtr - A system-standard hook
*	obj - hook-specific data object
*	... - The hook-specific message you wish to send.  The hook is
*	    expecting a pointer to the message, so a pointer into your
*	    stack will be sent.
*
*   RESULT
*	result - a hook-specific result.
*
*   NOTES
*	This function first appeared in the V37 release of amiga.lib.
*	However, it does not depend on any particular version of the OS,
*	and works fine even in V34.
*
*   EXAMPLE
*	If your hook's message was
*
*	    struct myMessage
*	    {
*		ULONG mm_FirstGuy;
*		ULONG mm_SecondGuy;
*		ULONG mm_ThirdGuy;
*	    };
*
*	You could write:
*
*	    result = CallHook( hook, obj, firstguy, secondguy, thirdguy );
*
*	as a shorthand for:
*
*	    struct myMessage msg;
*
*	    msg.mm_FirstGuy = firstguy;
*	    msg.mm_SecondGuy = secondguy;
*	    msg.mm_ThirdGuy = thirdguy;
*
*	    result = CallHookA( hook, obj, &msg );
*
*   SEE ALSO
*	CallHookA(), utility.library/CallHookPkt(), <utility/hooks.h>
*
******************************************************************************

******* amiga.lib/CallHookA **************************************************
*
*   NAME
*	CallHookA -- Invoke a hook given a pointer to a message.
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	result = CallHookA( hookPtr, obj, message )
*
*	ULONG CallHook( struct Hook *, Object *, APTR );
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Invoke a hook on the supplied hook-specific data (an "object")
*	and a parameter packet ("message").  This function is equivalent
*	to utility.library/CallHookPkt().
*
*   INPUTS
*	hookPtr - A system-standard hook
*	obj - hook-specific data object
*	message - The hook-specific message you wish to send
*
*   RESULT
*	result - a hook-specific result.
*
*   NOTES
*	This function first appeared in the V37 release of amiga.lib.
*	However, it does not depend on any particular version of the OS,
*	and works fine even in V34.
*
*   SEE ALSO
*	CallHook(), utility.library/CallHookPkt(), <utility/hooks.h>
*
******************************************************************************

******* amiga.lib/HookEntry **************************************************
*
*   NAME
*	HookEntry -- Assembler to HLL conversion stub for hook entry.
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	result = HookEntry( struct Hook *, Object *, APTR )
*	D0                  A0             A2        A1
*
*   FUNCTION
*	By definition, a standard hook entry-point must receive the
*	hook in A0, the object in A2, and the message in A1.  If your
*	hook entry-point is written in a high-level language and is
*	expecting its parameters on the stack, then HookEntry() will
*	put the three parameters on the stack and invoke the function
*	stored in the hook h_SubEntry field.
*
*	This function is only useful to hook implementers, and is
*	never called from C.
*
*   INPUTS
*	hook - pointer to hook being invoked
*	object - pointer to hook-specific data
*	msg - pointer to hook-specific message
*
*   RESULT
*	result - a hook-specific result.
*
*   NOTES
*	This function first appeared in the V37 release of amiga.lib.
*	However, it does not depend on any particular version of the OS,
*	and works fine even in V34.
*
*   EXAMPLE
*	If your hook dispatcher is this:
*
*	dispatch( struct Hook *hookPtr, Object *obj, APTR msg )
*	{
*	    ...
*	}
*
*	Then when you initialize your hook, you would say:
*
*	myhook.h_Entry = HookEntry;	/* amiga.lib stub */
*	myhook.h_SubEntry = dispatch;	/* HLL entry */
*
*   SEE ALSO
*	CallHook(), CallHookA(), <utility/hooks.h>

******************************************************************************

******* amiga.lib/DoMethodA **************************************************
*
*   NAME
*	DoMethodA -- Perform method on object.
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	result = DoMethodA( obj, msg )
*
*	ULONG DoMethodA( Object *, Msg );
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message
*	on the specified object.  The message is invoked on the
*	object's true class.
*
*   INPUTS
*	obj - pointer to boopsi object
*	msg - pointer to method-specific message to send
*
*   RESULT
*	result - specific to the message and the object's class.
*
*   NOTES
*	This function first appears in the V37 release of amiga.lib.
*	While it intrinsically does not require any particular release
*	of the system software to operate, it is designed to work with
*	the boopsi subsystem of Intuition, which was only introduced
*	in V36.
*	Some early example code may refer to this function as DM().

*	ULONG DoMethod( Object *, ULONG, ... );
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message
*	on the specified object.  The message is invoked on the
*	object's true class.  Equivalent to DoMethodA(), but allows

*	obj - pointer to boopsi object
*	MethodID - which method to send (see <intuition/classusr.h>)
*	... - method-specific message built on the stack

*   NAME
*	CoerceMethodA -- Perform method on coerced object.
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	result = CoerceMethodA( cl, obj, msg )
*
*	ULONG CoerceMethodA( struct IClass *, Object *, Msg );
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message
*	on the specified object, as though it were the specified
*	class.
*
*   INPUTS

*	result - class and message-specific result.
*
*   NOTES

*
*   FUNCTION
*	Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message
