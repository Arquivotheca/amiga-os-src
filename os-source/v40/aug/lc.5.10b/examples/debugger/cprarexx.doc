An ARexx interface is supported by the Lattice CodeProbe Debugger (CPR).
This directory contains a number of useful macros, which are recognized
by a ".cpr" extension.  To use these macros, you must load the ARexx
resident process,  "rexxmast", and place these macro files into your 
"rexx:" directory.

The macros simulate "wack" commands and include:
 
        avail.cpr         displays amount of total free memory
        dbptr.cpr         displays contents of a BPTR (i.e.; BCPL pointer)
        dbstr.cpr         displays a BSTR (i.e.; BCPL string)
        devices.cpr       displays the list of system devices
	devs.cpr	  displays the list of system devices
        execbase.cpr      displays execbase structure
	ints.cpr	  displays the list of interrupt handlers
        libraries.cpr     displays the list of system libraries
	libs.cpr	  displays the list of resident libraries
        makeaptr.cpr      takes BPTR and prints out APTR value   
        memory.cpr        dumps the amount of free memory
        mods.cpr          displays all system modules               
	ports.cpr	  displays the list of public ports
        regions.cpr       displays information on all the memory regions
	resources.cpr	  displays the list of system resources
        rsrcs.cpr         displays the list of system resources
        showcli.cpr       dumps a CLI structure of a CLI process
	showprocess.cpr   takes a process address or name and displays all
			  of its task and process fields.
        status.cpr        displays loaded CLI commands
        whichis.cpr       displays which CLI process is loaded 


CPR commands return status codes to ARexx as follows:   

	0	The debugger command was successful.
	1	The command was syntactically correct, but failed for some
		other reason.
	2   	A syntax error occurred.
	3	The debugger could not allocate memory for the ARexx
		message.

In addition to the above error codes, an ARexx macro can receive the 
output of a debugger command as it would normally appear in the Dialog
Window by invoking the ARexx command "options results".  The output
will then be accessable from the variable "result", provided that the
debugger returned a 0 return code.
