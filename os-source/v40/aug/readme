    $V/aug				September 13, 1989

    This directory, $V/aug, is for server storage of utilities
    that run on the Amiga.  The acronym "AUG" means "Amiga User's 
    Group."

    You might want to mount $V/aug as AUG: on your Amigas, and
    to put AUG:bin in your path.

    Note that all filenames here should thus be lower case.

    Subdirectories are:

    $V/aug/bin -amiga-format executables
    $V/aug/src -subdirectories with source for same
		native developed utilities should have their
		source directories satisfy the upcoming
		standards.
    $V/aug/doc -documentation files, e.g., SetCPU.doc
    $V/aug/libs-amiga format libraries
    $V/aug/devs-amiga format devices
