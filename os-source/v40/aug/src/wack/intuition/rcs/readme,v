@This directory contains the private extensions to Wack for peering
inside the secret bits of Intuition.  The following commands are
supported:

- Show the most interesting fields of IntuitionBase
- Show all Intuition classes.
- Show IntuitionBase semaphores and owners.
- Show screen structure with private fields
- Show window structure with private fields
- Show window flags including private ones
- Show/set the IBase->IDebug field.
- Show code version
- Show "thing" or "thing-list" (singly-linked list)

I recommend the following to be added to the startup.wack file for
anyone using the private Intuition stuff:

    'bindxwack ibase hd:bin/intuition.wack ibase'
    'bindxwack thing hd:bin/intuition.wack thing'
    'bindxwack things hd:bin/intuition.wack things'
    'bindxwack classes hd:bin/intuition.wack classes'
    'bindxwack isems hd:bin/intuition.wack isems'
    'bindxwack screen hd:bin/intuition.wack screen'
    'bindxwack window hd:bin/intuition.wack window'
    'bindxwack wflags hd:bin/intuition.wack wflags'
    'bindxwack idebug hd:bin/intuition.wack idebug'
    'bindxwack iversion hd:bin/intuition.wack version'
    'iversion'

(hd:bin is just where I put intuition.wack)

Note that we're replacing the internal (public) wack "window", "screen",
"ibase", and "wflags" commands with external (private) versions that
know about the secret fields.
