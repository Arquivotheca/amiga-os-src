   NAME
	MapROM - A Developer Tool for testing Kickstarts with the 3640 board

   SYNOPSIS
	MapROM <kickstartfile> [FORCE]

   FUNCTION
	MapROM is a tool that uses a feature of the A3640 (the Commodore
	68040 CPU board in the A4000 and A3000/040 systems) to let developers
	load disk-based kickstarts.

	MapROM will check to see if you are already running the kickstart
	that is contained in the file and if you have the memory required
	for the kickstart.  If the kickstart file is different than the
	current kickstart, it will replace it and cause a system reboot.
	Kickstarts loaded with MapROM do not go away until a full power down.

	The FORCE option can be used to force a reload of a kickstart image
	even if it is the same one.

	MapROM does *NOT* use the MMU of the 68040 CPU but some special
	hardware on the A3640 card.

   INPUTS
	FILE/A	- Required file name.  It should be the name of the
		  developer kickstart file for your machine.  The A4000
		  and A3000 kickstarts are *different* and can not be
		  interchanged.

	FORCE/S	- An option to FORCE the reloading of the kickstart even
		  if it matches.

   RESULTS
	If the kickstart is new and has loaded successfully, the system will
	reboot and use that kickstart.  If not, MapROM quietly exits.

   NOTES
	In order for this tool to work correctly with other system tools
	you should place it in the main C: directory.  Various developer
	tools will look for it there.  (This is SYS:C)

	Also, in order to use this tool, it *MUST* be run *ABSOLUTELY FIRST*
	in the Startup-Sequence.  It *MUST* come before SetPatch as it
	must not have the MMU turned on.  Since MapROM will either work
	or quietly exit, there is no problem with doing this.

	The standard setup is:

	IF EXISTS C:MapROM
		MapROM DEVS:Kickstart
	ENDIF

   SEE ALSO
	Your developer non-disclosure agreement.  This is a *developer only*
	tool and is not to be released to the public in any way.

   BUGS
	None?
