WISHLIST

Here are some features which I would like to implement in the future.

-	member() and nmember() conditions
-	$(macro:from=to)
-	replace the macro and rule Lists with binary trees for faster searches
-	:: rules to supply alternate rules for targets
-	+ command prefix to force the execution of lines
-	force the execution of lines containing $(MAKE) or ${MAKE}
-	the $^ automatic variable
-	.IGNORE .PRECIOUS .SILENT
-	static pattern rules
-	the ability to apply rules to the contents of archives
	and link libraries
-	vpath and VPATH search paths for dependencies

-	-W command line argument to run Make with a ``what if'' scenario
-	parallel remote execution of compiles

-	the ability to pass variables between nested executions of Make
