				SETPAR

USAGE:
    SETPAR [options]

OPTIONS:
    Slow, ACK, Fast

PURPOSE:
    To select the default parallel.device I/O mode.

SPECIFICATION:
    The SETPAR command will select the default I/O mode to be used by
    the parallel device on the next exclusive OpenDevice(). This new
    mode will remain in effect until the parallel device is expunged.

    The FAST mode sends over 100,000 characters per second out the
    parallel port (on 25MHZ 68030), but some printers might not assert
    the BUSY pin fast enough for this mode. In such a case, use the
    ACK mode, which works with all Centronics compatible printers.
    Printers which have very small buffers might be slower with any of
    these turbo modes. In that case use the factory default SLOW mode.

EXAMPLES:
    1> SETPAR Fast		100K+ chars/sec on 25MHz 68030
    1> SETPAR ACK		60K+ chars/sec on 25MHz 68030
    1> SETPAR Slow		9K+ chars/sec on 25MHz 68030
