# The source code to sfd is a lex file (sfd.l), which exists only
# on the Sun, and is converted using lex running on the Sun.  The
# resulting sfd.c file may be compiled on the Sun or on the Amiga.
#
# The Sun directory containing the sources to sfd is V:tools/src/sfd.
#
# The Amiga version of sfd is found in V:aug/src/sfd, along with a
# makefile which grabs sfd.c from here and compiles it.
#
# REMEMBER:  SFD.C IS NOT SOURCE CODE!

# This rule gets a fresh copy of sfd.c from the Sun (where lex
# created it based on sfd.l, the true source to sfd), then
# compiles it on the Amiga.  After compilation, we delete sfd.c
# to underscore the fact that it is not the source code!

amiga:
	copy V39:tools/src/sfd/sfd.c ""
	lc -L -b0 sfd
	delete sfd.c

# This rule installs sfd into V39:aug/bin.

install:
	delete V39:aug/bin/sfd
	copy sfd V39:aug/bin/sfd

	delete V39:aug/doc/sfd.doc
	copy V39:tools/doc/sfd.doc V39:aug/doc/sfd.doc
