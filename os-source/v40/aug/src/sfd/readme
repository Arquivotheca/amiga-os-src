The source code to sfd is a lex file (sfd.l), which exists only
on the Sun, and is converted using lex running on the Sun.  The
resulting sfd.c file may be compiled on the Sun or on the Amiga.

The Sun directory containing the sources to sfd is V:tools/src/sfd.

The Amiga version of sfd is found in V:aug/src/sfd, along with a
makefile which grabs sfd.c from here and compiles it.

REMEMBER:  SFD.C IS NOT SOURCE CODE!
