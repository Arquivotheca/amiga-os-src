	with Dice V2.06.36 (registered version only) (or newer).

TODO
	Further testing on many different Amiga systems and many
	configurations.

PURPOSE & THEORY
	ASwarm is a screenblanker. The graphic during blanking phase is based
	upon Jeff Buterworth's 'xswarm' for X11-Windows.

	A screenblankers goal should be to blank (disable) the screenoutput
	and to prevent burning in pixels or ghosted pictures on	the Monitor.

	As it is boring just to disable the screen, and as the Amiga can
	handle multitasking, we could also draw some funny stuff while blanking
	the screen. Only problem is that, when we draw something, we must take
	care that our drawing doesn't itself burns into the monitor.

	This usually happens, when the screenblanker has not enough time
	to draw, so the graphics rest on the same place. When the
	screenblanker has not enough Cpu-time, it's because there is another
	cpu-greedy programm, such as a raytracer or C-compiler.

	Well, as the screenblanker isn't important for the user, we found
	a way to manage both cases: Screenblanker has Cpu-Time or not.
	When he has Cpu-Time, the blanker draws the funny graphics, when
	he hasn't, the screenblanker-draw routine is disabled and the screen is
	really blanked (black) until he gains back Cpu-Time.

	This is done with a simple server-client modell. The server runs
	with a normal priority, but just has a WaitPort()-loop (No real
	Cpu-use !) to detect the time-out and to detect the amount of Cpu-time.
	The client is started when the server reached the TIMEOUT, the client
	runs with a low priority. When the server reached the CLIENTTIMEOUT and
	remarks that the client wasn't able to draw anything, then the screen
	is really blanked.

VERSION
	To prevent a Version War, we renamed ASwarm to ASwarm II .
	There are some other versions of ASwarm or Swarm available, such
	as ASwarm as IPC-Port-Blanker for DMouse, written by
	Markus Illenseer (written in KickPascal, available with Source
	on demand), or Swarm by Nescum (sorry, dunno his real name), with
	assembler subroutines for the drawing, unfortunately not with the
	multiple-swarm option, and not based on the original routines.

	As ASwarm can be compiled with DICE _and_ (or) SAS-C, you can
	detect the Version with: (CLI) Version Aswarm full
	It will show you the used compiler. Default is SAS-C.
	Also the size of the binary should differ:
		11960 Bytes for the DICE version.
		9860  Bytes for the SAS-C version.

STARTING
	Aswarm is a COMMODITIE, therefore it _only_ runs under WB Release
	2.0 (V37.175) and higher. A Commoditie is normally started in the
	WBStartup-drawer. So it will be automatically started on the WB-start
	(loadwb, usually in the startup-sequence).
	So, just copy ASwarm and ASwarm.info to SYS:WBStartup.

	To get ASwarm started without rebooting now, double-click the icon.
	If the Tool Types aren't yet changed, a window shows up.
	This is the 'Edit-window' of ASwarm.

	Now click on the Gadget 'Hide' or the 'Close-Gadget' to close
	the window.

        ASwarm is now started. After 60 seconds the screen will be
	blanked, of course only when the user doesn't touch the keyboard or
	the mouse.

	You can start ASwarm from the CLI or another Shell.
	For example you can start ASwarm in the S:User-Startup:
		RUN >NIL: <NIL: ASwarm CX_POPUP=NO

	The arguments for CLI-Start are exactly the same as the Tool Types
	for the	WB-start.

ARGUMENTS
	As every good Commoditie, ASwarm supports Tool Type entries.
	Click the Aswarm.info and press Right-Amiga and i to change or
	add a Tool Type entry.

	In the Tool Type list there is (per default) entered:

		CX_POPUP=YES		# Show up the window when starting
		DONOTWAIT		# Tell WB to not wait on a return
		STARTPRI=-120		# low priority for starting

	These Tool Types are the normal way to give arguments for Commodities
	and pure WB-programms.
	Please refer also to your AmigaDOS Manual (Section Workbench Programms
	especially chapter The WBStartup Drawer) to get an idea of the Tool
	Types entries.

        TOOL TYPES:
		DONOTWAIT		When started from WBStartup, let
					WB know that it doesn't have to wait
					for ASwarm.

		STARTPRI=-120		When started from WBStartup, this
					is the starting prioritiy of ASwarm.

		CX_POPKEY=<Hotkey>	Please see below for the Hotkeys.
					The hotkey opens the Edit-Window
					of ASwarm.

		CX_POPUP=<YES | NO>	When ASwarm is started, the Edit-
					Window may show up when set to
					'YES' or any (!) other String
					than 'NO'.

		TIMEOUT=<1 - 3600>	This is the timeout counter in
					seconds. During this time NO input
					from the user must recognize in order
					to start the blanker. Usual time is
					about 60 secs.

		CLIENTTIMEOUT=<1 - 6>   After this time, the server
					disables the screen, he has then
					remarked that the client can't draw
					anything due of Cpu-time. Usual
					time is about 5 secs.

		DISPLAY=<Display Type>	Please see below for the Display Types.
					Here you can change the size of the
					screen on which ASwarms draws.

		SWARMS=<1 - 10>		The number of drawn swarms.

		BEES=<1 - 100>		The number of bees of each swarm.

	NOTE:
		Please remark that the Tool Types are case-sensitive.



HOT KEYS:
	Refer to your AmigaDOS Manual (Section The Extras Programs,
	The Commodities Drawer) to get a valid list of the available hot
	keys, the following may obsolete on a new Commodities.library
	version.


	SYPNOSIS:  [<qualifier> [<qualifier>...]] <key>

	    Qualifier keywords (Press and hold one or more qualifier)

	    alt           either Alt key
	    ralt          right Alt key
	    lalt          left Alt key
	    shift         either Shift key
	    rshift        right Shift key
	    lshift        left Shift key
	    capslock      Caps Lock key
	    rcommand      right Amiga key

	    rbutton       Click (and hold) the right mouse button
	    midbutton     Click (and hold) the middle mouse button
	                  (only avail for mice with a connected third button!)
	    leftbutton    Click (and hold) the left mouse button
	    newprefs      Preferences changed
	    diskremoved   Disk removed
	    diskinserted  Disk inserted


	    Keys (to be pressed and released, only ONE Key can be chosen)

	    a .. z, 0 .. 9, etc.   Normal keys
	    f1 .. f10              Function keys
	    up, down, left, right  Cursor keys
	    help                   Help key
	    del                    Delete key
	    return                 Return key
	    enter                  Enter key
				    (MUST be combined with 'numericpad'!)
	    backspace              Backspace key
	    esc                    Escape key
	    space                  Space key
	    comma                  Comma key
	    upstroke               Upstroke key


	    Examples

	    lalt ralt enter
	    ramiga f10
	    alt x
	    lalt numericpad enter


   NOTE: Choose your hotkeys CAREFULLY, because Commodities have a high
	 priority in the input events chain (i.e. will override existing
	 definitions). Also some hotkeys don't make sense or do collide
	 with other tools or functions of the WB.

   NOTE: The Workbench screen will be moved to front before starting the tool
	 via HotKey.

   NOTE: When a combination of qualifiers and keys is illegal, ASwarm
	 will NOT start (and will NOT show up an error-code).
	 Example for illegal combinations:
	    lalt a b			# Two keys specified
	    control rcommand lcommand	# trivial :-)
	    leftbutton 			# No key specified


EDIT WINDOW
	When the CX_POPUP is set to 'YES' and ASwarm is being started or when
	the hot key was pressed, a window shows up on the Workbench.
	Normally, the workbench is moved to the front.

	We've tested Aswarm's Edit Window under many circumstances,
	please give us a short note when you have a problem with it.

	You will see some Gadgets and a Scroll-List. In the Titlebar of
	the window you'll see the hot key definition (may not complete).

	The values inside the Text-Gadgets are via default set to the
	supplied Arguments in the Tool Types or CLI-Parameters.
	On a wrong Enter, the value will be reset to the old value.

	TIMER:		The speciefied value for the timeout of the
			blanker. After this time (in seconds) the ASwarm
			shows up. Value may between 1 and 3600.

	CLIENT TIMEOUT:	The time the server gives to the client for not
			being able to draw anything, then the screen will
			be blanked really to prevent burn-ins.

	SWARMS:		The number of the flying swarms.

	BEES PER SWARM:	The number of the bees of each swarm.

	HIDE:		(click or press 'h') Hide the window. All then new
			entered values will be stored and acivated on the
			next blank.

	BLANK:		(click or press 'b') Blank immediately. All then
			new entered values will be stored and activated.

	QUIT:		(click or press 'q')

	DISPLAY MODE:	(Please refer to the notes below!) Choose a
			desired Mode for the Display during blank-time.
			Use the scroll-bar to show up other available
			modes. This depends on the used system.

COMMODITIES EXCHANGE
	With the Exchange Tool, you can temporarly stop ASwarm with
	DISABLE, restart it with ENABLE, remove ASwarm with KILL (as would do
	a Quit in the Edit-Window), SHOW up the Edit-Window, and HIDE the
	Edit-Window.

	The Exchange Tool is a comfort way to remove or dis/enable
	ASwarm.

	Please refer to the AmigaDOS Manual (Section AmigaDOS Reference
	and Workbench Programms) for further docs on Exhange Tool.



DISPLAY MODES:
	Please, please, please have care here !!!! We are NOT responsible
	for ANY user-error. The given list depends on the used System.
	All newer Amigas, such as A500+ , A3000 do have the ECS Denise
	for extended Screen Modes (Not all Amiga's with Kick 2.0 on ROM
	do have a ECS Denise..). Of course you can start the desired
	Modes, but not all modes are available on all MONITORS !
	Please do refer to your Manual of the Monitor and to the AmigaDOS
	Manual (Section Workbench Programms, AddMonitor) for more
	informations.

	Why ? Simply because you can DESTROY your Monitor!

        Here is a list of the (normally given) ECS Display Modes:

		NTSC:Lores
		NTSC:Hires
		NTSC:SuperHires
		NTSC:Lores-Interlaced
		NTSC:Hires-Interlaced
		NTSC:SuperHires-Interlaced
		PAL:Lores
		PAL:Hires
		PAL:SuperHires			# My preferred Mode
		PAL:Lores-Interlaced
		PAL:Hires-Interlaced
		PAL:SuperHires-Interlaced
		VGA-ExtraLores                  # -
		VGA-ExtraLores-Interlaced	#
		VGA-Lores                       #
		VGA-Lores-Interlaced            #   Multiscan Monitor needed
		Productivity                    #
		Productivity-Interlaced         # -
		A2024_10Hz                      #
		A2024_15Hz                      #   A2024 needed.

	Overscan is used for all modes, adjust your Overscan-size with
	the ScreenMode Preference Tool.

	NOTE:
	     DON'T use VGA-Modes on a NON-Multisync or NON-VGA-Monitor
	     DON'T even test Modes if you aren't sure about your
	     Monitor-capacibilities.

	As the original xswarm runs on a X11-Workstation, and as those
	ones have high graphics resolutions, i prefer Superhires, as
	this Mode comes	near to them.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	We do know of some problems and strange behaviours, some of them
	aren't strange anymore, when you read this:

	-  Are your running ARQ 1.66 or below ?
	   (A replacement Tool for the system requestors).
	   Then you may try this:

	   Change the timeout to a low value, e.g. 5 secs, then type in
	   the CLI: wait 10 <RETURN>      (do not wait for the prompt)
	            dir bafasel: <RETURN> (device blafasel: nonexisting)

	   ASwarm will blank as usual, but then ARQ pops up a requestor
	   ON the ASwarm-Screen !! You can't close the Screen until you
	   click on 'Abort'. And ASwarm can't blank the screen either
	   anymore ! (It's ScreenClose() Command waits for the succesfull
	   return...)

	   This is a BUG in ARQ ! It's dangerous in some cases. It may
	   burn in the requestor... (Martin Laubach, author of ARQ is
	   being contacted..)

	-  You are running a C-Compiler or a raytracer. ASwarm goes
	   blank, but doesn't show any swarm, and during disk-access Aswarm
	   comes up for a while.

	   This is not a Bug, this is the FEATURE of ASwarm !! This is
	   the way ASwarm blanks when high Cpu-use happens on the startup.
	   And during disk-access the Cpu-time is usually less, so ASwarm
	   may find time to draw something.

	-  Collision with other Blankers. Well, in fact you can run as
	   many Blankers as you want. Such as Dmouse, Spliner, FracBlanc.
           ASwarm does always try to move it's screen to front, when it
	   detects to be behind some other screens.

	-  When a disk is inserted, ASwarm closes the screen (dis-blanks).
	   This is normal. Disk-replacement is detected as an input
	   Event. As all input events shall disable the Blanker this one
	   should, too.

	-  ASwarm doesn't start, though it's been placed in WBStartup.
	   Well, this happens when a wrong combination of hot keys was
	   used. Please try to enter a new one. Test the hot key !

	-  ASwarm shows up the window though the Tool Type CX_POPUP is
	   set to 'NO'. This happens when ASwarm is started twice.
	   (Double-click (or call from CLI) = start, another double-click
	    (or call from CLI) opens the window)

	-  ASwarm is damn slow. Huh .. sorry :-) The Authors have fast
	   machines.. Try to reduce the swarm-size (BEES) and the amount
	   of swarms. Or use another, less big screen.

	-  ASwarm makes noice when it blanks the screen. This may happen
           when a Display Mode is choosen, which is not of the size of
	   the since then activ screen. Nothing dangerous.

	-  ASwarm makes flickers on the Monitor when it blanks the Screen.
	   This happen when ASwarm blanks on a PAL-Screen, but the since
	   then or then active Screen is or was NTSC. (Or vice versa)
	   The Monitor needs a bit time to synchronize again. Nothing
	   dangerous.

FINAL
	Ever seen 'After Dark' ?
	Combine several screenblankers on the SAME screen (Warp, Spliner,
	ASwarm on the same screen :-) Change the graphic routine and the
	so given blanker via random or time-table.
	We want to work on this... I have MANY ideas for screenblankers.
