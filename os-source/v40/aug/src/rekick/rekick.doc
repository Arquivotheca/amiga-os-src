   NAME
	ReKick

   SYNOPSIS
	ReKick - A tool to run special test Kickstarts on A2000/A500 machines

   FUNCTION
	ReKick is a tool for A2000 and A500 systems with at least 1Meg of
	AutoConfig RAM at $200000.  It, along with the special kickstart
	files designed for ReKick, will let developers and beta testers of
	our new kickstarts boot into the kickstart.

	ReKick does *NOT* require that the autoconfig memory be the first
	board in the system and thus will work with systems that have
	A2091 with RAM or A590 with RAM.  (Since the drive part configured
	before the RAM did...)  Also, ReKick will fully configure the boards
	using the new kickstart.  This means that there are no limitations
	to the type of boards that the system should correctly understand
	with ReKick vs ROM kickstarts.

	ReKick works by first checking to see if the system has memory
	to support it.  It will then check for a file in DEVS:Kickstart.
	This file must be of the correct format and it must pass certain
	consistancy checks.  After the file has been loaded and checked,
	ReKick will print a notice and give you 3 seconds to abort the
	reboot.  If you do not reboot, you will be booted into the normal
	boot process of the new, beta kickstart.

	Since ReKick will quietly fail if there is no DEVS:Kickstart or
	if you have already been ReKick'ed, it is very easy to just have
	ReKick as the first line of the startup-sequence.

	ReKick takes a single command line parameter that is parsed as
	the filename of the kickstart.  If no command line parameter is
	given, ReKick will use DEVS:Kickstart as the file name.

	ReKick can also be started from Workbench.  When started from
	Workbench, it will take any command line parameters and it will
	not give you a chance to abort it.

   INPUTS
	A valid kickstart file in DEVS:Kickstart or in the file name
	given at the command line.

   RESULTS
	A system running the beta Kickstart

   NOTE
	Due to the fact that you are not really in ROM with the kickstart,
	and since this trick does not use the MMU (it works on 68000 machines)
	the ROM is *not* write protected.  Writes to ROM may well crash the
	system.

	Due to the methods required for BootMenu to operate, BootMenu may
	not be possible with ReKick'ed machines.

	Note that the command line parameter is not parsed but is assumed
	to be a complete file name.  This means that if you wish to have
	the file "test disk:kickstart file" used you would use:

	      ReKick test disk:kickstart file

	No quotes are required since it only takes the one argument.
