	Suck is an old program, last compiled years ago.
	Works fine, though ;^)  Watch out on huge machines.

    Suck Notes

    Suck -- a low-memory debugging tool

    Operations:
	suck available memory by repeated AllocMem
	suck chunks of user-specified size (> (sizeof struct Node))
	give back user-specified number of chunks at end of suck
	free all sucked memory
	install AllocMem vector 

    Frills
	select standard size chunks from menu (RastPorts, ...)
	selectable Debug() on AllocMem failure
	status line: "number of chunks sucked ..."
	avail update

    Design
	gadgets:
	    chunk size :longint
	    chunks to free back: longint
	    suck:	boolean
	    return:	boolean
	    dubugwhenout: boolean
	    avail:	bool
	status line: 	itext
	    clear
	    can't free more than sucked (all freed)
	    have sucked chunks, freed, ...
	    have returned
	    avail mem:
	menus:
	    sizeof stuff

	internal:
	    chunkList
	    number of chunks on list
	    chunksize, numfree, alloctrap, debugon
