NAME
	Angel -- Stand by the programmer who invoked you

SYNTAX
	angel [?|On|Off|Quiet|Report|NoChip]

DESCRIPTION
	This command installs a trap handler named Guardian-Angel for its
	divine nature. The handler reports on the serial port at 9600 baud
	all memory accesses to page zero, memory above 16 Megabytes and
	writes to ROM. Keep it by your side at all times.

	Programs which allocate a large block of memory and then free it up
	in small chunks risk confusing your Guardian-Angel, and may result
	in a Guru $F1000005. This practice is allowed as long as the
	granularity of the small chunks is no smaller than the granularity
	of the AllocMem() function. The Exec supplied function has a
	granularity of 8 bytes. The Guardian-Angel replaces it with 256 bytes.

	The sequence Forbid()-FreeMem(block)-access freed memory block, is
	allowed and the Guardian-Angel will understand your good intentions.

OPTIONS
	ON	Installs the trap handler and enables reporting on the serial
		port at 9600 baud.
	OFF	Removes the Guardian-Angel, and SetFunction's the old memory
		routines back. A little memory remains lost though.
	QUIET	Turns off reporting. The trap handler remains installed though.
	REPORT	Turns reporting back on.
	NOCHIP	Does not monitor free CHIP memory, only FAST memory.

	From the remote terminal:

	Ctrl-S	Suspends output until another character is sent.
	Ctrl-X	Ignores all output until another character is sent. The
		difference between this and the QUIET option is that the
		quiet option ignores only output from the trap handler,
		thus allowing other programs' kprintf's to continue output.
	Del	Drops the Amiga into ROM-Wack, or whatever debugger has
		SetFunction()'ed the Debug() function.

ENHANCEMENT
	Possible future enhancements include handling of CHIP free memory,
	perhaps when people have more than 1Meg CHIP memory, and support of
	A3000's with SuperKickstart.

NOTES
	Under SuperKickstart, the Guardian-Angel cannot be made QUIET. Before
	rebooting the computer, the Guardian-Angel must be turned off,
	otherwise the SuperKickstart will not find its usual translation table
	at startup.

	The layers library has a bug in versions 36.89 and earlier. This bug
	occurs when Memacs is launched for example. The Guardian-Angel will
	make sure that you are running layers 36.92, or a more recent version.
