   NAME
	EndRun

   SYNOPSIS
	EndRun [command] - Execute a given command with Workbench closed

   FUNCTION
	EndRun closes the initial CLI window and Workbench screen,
	then executes the given command.  Runing with the screen closed
	saves memory space.  EndRun is the *only* officially supported way
	to run with a closed Workbench screen under both 1.3 and 2.0
	Kickstarts.

   INPUTS
	[command] is the command line to be executed.  The first
	word in the command will be the load file as passed to LoadSeg().
	If no command line is given, EndRun will simply halt.

   RESULTS
	The given command is run with the Workbench screen closed.

   EXAMPLE
	; startup-sequence for SnakePit
	EndRun SnakePit datafile
	; Note that we run the snakepit program with the
	; argument "datafile" which is passed to the program.

   NOTES
	EndRun exists because programmers have used a variety of
	unsupportable tricks to recover the memory used by the Workbench
	screen.  EndRun is guaranteed to continue functioning in future
	releases.

	Note that 2.0-specific programs don't need EndRun.  Disks
	installed with 2.0 install are set to "silent" mode.  The
	Workbench screen remains closed until the first output.  Simply
	ensure that all output is redirected to >NIL: <NIL:, and the
	Workbench screen will never open.

	The [command] will not have any functioning stdin/stdout.
	stdin/stdout will be connected to NIL:

	EndRUN *MUST* have V1.2 or greater kickstart.  It also *MUST*
	be executed from a CLI (usually from the startup-sequence).

	EndRun has a maximum COMMAND name (first word in the command line)
	of 64 characters.  It will not work correctly with more.
	The rest of the command line can be as long as you wish.

	When the program exits, EndRun will just halt.  It will go
	into a dead loop.  However, applications run with EndRun
	are usually of the type the user uses with a reboot as this
	utility is design for use in startup sequences.
