The Story of SysLock

SysLock got started after Carolyn was worried about our computers
being open holes into CBMVAX and the Amiga source code.  So, with a
bit of coding and thinking, SysLock 1.0 was born.  You would hit a
hot-key and it would start grabbing all input events until you
re-entered the passcode you entered when you locked it.  This was
great stuff and took very little memory.  But, people liked it
so it had to be changed.  (Axiom #2 of computerdom:  Any program
that works well will have to be modified.)  Thus came SysLock 1.1
and SysLock 1.2, each smaller than the previous, and each with
more features.  (How was that done?!?)  Well, one more feature
has now been added:  Selectable hot keys.  (CLI settable only)

1.4 added support for 2.0 Cache calls in order to work with CopyBack
mode on the 68040...


Features and Usage:

SysLock is very simple to use.  Just type SYSLOCK from the CLI
or double click on its icon.  It will then either install or
deinstall itself and tell you what it did.

When it is installed, it does nothing until you press the hot key.
(The default is LEFT-SHIFT/LEFT-AMIGA/SPACE)  It will then ask
you for the locking code.  Type in any code you wish.  You should
keep it under 60 or so characters as it would otherwise
be difficult to re-enter correctly.  ( :-) )  Anyway, if, for some
reason you wish to abort the entering of the locking code, press
the HELP key.  To end the locking code, press the RETURN key.
Note that SHIFTed, CTRLed, ALTed, AMIGAed, CAPSed, etc. codes
are different from non-modified codes.  So, if you LEFT-SHIFT
everything, including the return, you will have to LEFT-SHIFT it
when you wish to unlock the system.

Once a locking code is entered, the screen will show the System
Locked message.  The screen will fade out slowly, but any mouse
or keyboard input will bring it back.  In the top left-hand corner,
there will be a number (blank if ZERO) that tells of the number
of failed attempts at accessing the system.

The CLI invocation of SysLock lets you pick the key code and
qualifiers that should be used as the hot key.  This is done
with the command parameters -cXX and -qXX  The XX stand for
2-digit HEX values.

SysLock is very small.  It is 2000 bytes in file size.  When
installed, it takes a TOTAL of 2680 bytes of memory, including
all structures and tables it needs but not including the small
320x50x1 screen that is opened when the system is locked.

SysLock will not uninstall itself if the installed SysLock is
in the locked state, so you can not CRON a SysLock to unlock
your system at some time.



Picking the keycode for the hot-key:

For the -cXX field, you would use the HEX raw key value for that
key. SysLock does not check to see if that key exists, so please do
not use keys such as 30 (-c30) since there is none on the keyboard.
Also, it is best if you do not use the SHIFT/CTRL/ALT/AMIGA keys as
your hot-key. It should work, but you will have to find the correct
qualifier values for it.  The default of SPACE is -c40.



Picking the qualifier for the hot-key:

For the -qXX field, you would OR together the qualifiers you wish to
have required for the hot-key.  If they key has anything but a
perfect match, it will not be used as the hot key.  The values are:

		IEQUALIFIER_LSHIFT	 0x0001
		IEQUALIFIER_RSHIFT	 0x0002
		IEQUALIFIER_CAPSLOCK	 0x0004
		IEQUALIFIER_CONTROL	 0x0008
		IEQUALIFIER_LALT	 0x0010
		IEQUALIFIER_RALT	 0x0020
		IEQUALIFIER_LCOMMAND	 0x0040	* Amiga key
		IEQUALIFIER_RCOMMAND	 0x0080	* Amiga key

For example:  If you wish to have LEFT-Shift, LEFT-Amiga, you would
use a value of 41  (-q41)  This also is the default.

So, to set the key code and qualifiers you would do:

SysLock -c40 -q41  ; This just happens to be the default.
