This is yet another lens program.  I did this after having
written a *VERY* fast magnify routine.  It was rather trivial
as you can see by the source code: MKS_Lens.c  The Magnify
routine is in Magnify.asm and is as close to optimal as I have
seen.  (Only 3 lines optimized by CAPE, so there are some, but
CAPE takes care of that...)

The Lens program has no checks for special cases and is therefore
rather slow when you bring it down to a 1-to-1 magnification.
(Compaired to a special case situation...)

To use, just run from the CLI or WorkBench.

The gadgets are:

Bottom-Left:  The HashMark:  This turns on/off the pixel grid.

              The "FAST":    This turns on/off the "FAST" mode.
                             In Normal use, the program does a
                             Delay(3) between each update.  With
                             "FAST" on, it will do the updates as
                             quickly as possible...

Bottom-Right: The +/- gads:  These change the magnification factor
                             in either X or Y.  The magnification
                             factor is limited to the range of
                             [1,16] (closed interval)

                             Shift-Clicking on the gadget will change
                             both X and Y if possible.
                             (That is:  If you Shift-Click the X+
                              and X can be increased then Y will be
                              increased)
