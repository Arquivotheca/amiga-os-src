   NAME
	Recolor

   SYNOPSIS
	Recolor - A icon recoloring tool

   FUNCTION
	The tool is an icon recoloring tool that is fully configurable.
	It can swap/shift the colors of the selected icons when its
	menu item is selected.

	You can also drop the selected icons into the Recolor window.
	This will also recolor the icons.

	To configure the recoloring process, you just add tooltypes to
	the recolor icon.  The tool types express the color table
	swaps that are to happen and the order in which they should happen.

	The default tooltype in the icon is set for swapping colors 1 & 2
	as this is what most people would need.

	The TRUNCATE tooltype will tell RECOLOR to truncate the icon
	to a depth.  Some older icon builders had made the icon image
	depth field incorrect.  On deeper screens or while recoloring,
	this can cause strange results.  By setting the TRUNCATE value
	to the depth of the icon desired, Recolor will set the depth
	and thus clean up the image.

	Example tool types:

		TRUNCATE=2		* Truncate to a depth of 2.

		SWAP=1:2		* This is the default b/w swap

		SWAP=1:3
		SWAP=2:1		* This is a 1-3-2 swap/rotate

		SWAP=7:2		* This swaps colors 7 and 2

	Note:	That is the output color is more bit planes that the
		initial icon, strange things may happen.

	Recolor can also take these parameters as command line arguments.
	For example:

		Recolor			; No arguments defaults to SWAP=1:2
		Recolor swap=2:3		; Swap 2 & 3
		Recolor swap=1:3 swap=2:1	; Swap 1 - 3 - 2
		Recolor truncate=2		; Truncate to 2 bit planes

   INPUTS
	tooltype -- The swapping information
	icons -- Selected icons when the menu item is selected
	         or the icons that are dropped on the window.

   RESULTS
	An icon written to disk with the new color setup.

   SEE ALSO
	None

   BUGS
	Does not handle icons with image structures that have non-standard
	plane-pick and plane-on/off values.  But then, neither does
	icon.library... :-)
