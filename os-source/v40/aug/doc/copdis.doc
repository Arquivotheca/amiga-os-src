COPDIS


Copdis was developed in support of the AA chips and will
attempt to translate hexidecimal copper lists into an
ASCII representation utilizing its knowledge of the AA
chips.  No only can the currently active copper lists be
translated, but also the intermediate copper lists for the
currently visible views.

FORMAT
The output format is similiar to what one might find for a
disassembler.  The format for a final copper is is the
following:

00021B78  1401 FFFF		WAIT	vpos=14,hpos=0
00021208  0084 0002 0086 1B78	MOVEL	00021B78, cop2lc	;copper second location
000211F0  0104 0024		MOVE	0024, bplcon2	 ZDBPSEL=0 PF2PF=4 PF1P=4	;bit plane priority control

<Address> <Hex code>		<Opcode><Operands>	 <Translation>			<LongName>

<Address> points to the location where the command is
stored.  This is an hexidecimal value.

<Hex code> is the hexidecimal value of the copper
insturction.  This will be either two, or four sixteen bit
words.

<Opcode> is the ASCII representation of the action required
by the copper instruction.  The four valid values are WAIT,
MOVEL, MOVE and SKIP.

<Operands> detail the data manipulated by the Opcode.  The
actual values for the operands differ for the four
commands.

<Translation> will only be given for a MOVE instruction.
This is an attempt to take the data moved and present a
more understandable representation.

<Long Name> will only be given for the MOVE and MOVEL
instructions.  This is more complete description of the
purpose of the register into which the data is being moved.

Intermediate Copper Lists
Intermediate copper lists will be shown in the same format.
There are, however, three and six words hex code for
intermediate copper lists.

COMMAND LINE
C=COMMENTS/S,D=DATA/S,N=NOCOLOURS/S,I=NOCOPINIT/S,F=NOFINAL/S,
SAFELY/S,ID=INTERDISP/S,SS=SPRITESET/S,SC=SPRITECLEAR/S,
U=USER/S,NORAW/S,NT=NOTRANS/S

COMMENTS
Unless this keyword is present the <Long Name> field will
not be printed.

DATA
When this keyword is present all referenced addresses will
be set to zero.  All referenced addresses refers to the
<Address> field, any address loaded in the <Hex code>
field and addresses in the <Operand> field.

There is one exception to the supression of the last
address type.  For bit plane registers in intermediate
copper lists, the address will be replaced with a
displacement to the bit plane pointer of the form:

offset(BPx)

where offset is a signed decimal offset from the start of
the bit plane given in the x value.

NOCOLOURS
When this keyword is present all writes to color registers
will not be printed.  Instead the line,

***Colour registers - surpressed

will be printed once for every group of writes to color
registers.

NOCOPINIT
When this keyword is present the final copper list pointed
to by GFXBase->copinit will not be printed.

NOFINAL
When this keyword is present the two final copper lists for
the two fields GFXBase->ActiView->LOFCprList->start and
GFXBase->ActiView->SHFCprList->start will not be printed.

SAFELY
When this keyword is present the copper list semaphore will
be obtained before doing any processing of copper lists.
This keyword should be utilized whenever possible to
prevent the system from changing the copper list while it
is being disassembled.

INTERDISP
When this keyword is present the intermediate display
copper lists will be printed for any visible ViewPorts.  If
the lists are empty nothing will be printed.  Each
ViewPort's copper list will be preceeded by the pointer to
the ViewPort.

SPRITESET
When this keyword is present the intermediate sprite set
copper lists will be printed for any visible ViewPorts.  If
lists are empty nothing will be printed.  Each ViewPort's
copper list will be preceeded by the pointer to the
ViewPort.

SPRITECLEAR
When this keyword is present the intermediate sprite clear
copper lists will be printed for any visible ViewPorts.  If
the lists are empty nothing will be printed.  Each
ViewPort's copper list will be preceeded by the pointer to
the ViewPort.

USER
When this keyword is present the intermediate user copper
lists will be printed for any visible ViewPorts.  If the
lists are empty nohting will be printed.  Each ViewPort's
copper list will be preceeded by the pointer to the
ViewPort.

NORAW
When this keyword is present the <Hex code> field will not
be printed.

NOTRANS
When this keyword is present the <Translation> field will
not be printed.
