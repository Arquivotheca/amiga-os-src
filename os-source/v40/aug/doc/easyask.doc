Introduction
------------
EasyAsk provides access to intuition.library/EasyRequest from AmigaDOS and
ARexx scripts.

EasyAsk allows the user to specify the text, gadgets, title, and IDCMP flags
(DISKINSERTED and DISKREMOVED currently supported) used to create the
EasyRequest and the AmigaDOS return codes to be associated with user
gadget selections and IDCMP events in the requester.

EasyAsk requires Kickstart/Workbench Release 2.0 or higher.

Description
-----------
TEXT		Specifies text to display in EasyRequest;
		the vertical bar character (|) is used to delimit lines.

		For example, a TEXT argument of
		"This is a requester|created with EasyAsk" specifies
		a two-line requester containing:
			This is a requester
			created with EasyAsk

		The TEXT argument is REQUIRED unless the ABOUT switch
		is specified.

GADGETS		Specifies gadgets to display in EasyRequest;
		the vertical bar character (|) is used to delimit gadgets.

		For example, a GADGETS argument of "Ok|Ok Quick|Cancel"
		specifies three gadgets: "Ok", "Ok Quick", and "Cancel".

		The GADGETS argument is REQUIRED unless the ABOUT switch
		is specified.

VALUES		Specifies the AmigaDOS return codes to associate with
		each gadget; the vertical bar character (|) is used to
		delimit return codes; the first return code is associated
		with the first gadget, the second return code is associated
		with the second gadget, etc. For example, a VALUES argument
		argument of "0|5|20" specifies that the first gadget is
		to cause a return code of 0, the second gadget is to cause
		a return code of 5, and the third gadget is to cause
		a return code of 20.

		The VALUES argument is optional. If the argument is not
		specified, the ordinal (starting at 0) number of the gadget
		selected by the user will be the return code. For example,
		if the user selected the third gadget, the return code would
		be 2.

ABOUT		If the ABOUT switch is specified, the EasyAsk copyright
		message is displayed, all other arguments are ignored, and
		the program terminates with return code 0.

TITLE		Specifies the requester title.

		For example, TITLE "Easy Script" causes the requester
		title bar to display "Easy Script."

		The TITLE argument is optional. If the argument is not
		specified, the requester will be untitled.

DISKINSERTED	Specifies the requester should return if a disk is
		inserted while the requester is displayed.

		The return code specified by DISKVALUE (which is required
		if this switch is specified) will be returned if a disk
		is inserted while the requester is displayed.

DISKREMOVED	Specifies the requester should return if a disk is
		removed while the requester is displayed.

		The return code specified by DISKVALUE (which is required
		if this switch is specified) will be returned if a disk
		is removed while the requester is displayed.

DISKVALUE	Specifies the return code to associate with
		DISKINSERTED and/or DISKREMOVED events.

		For example, if DISKVALUE is 5, and both the DISKINSERTED
		and DISKREMOVED switches are specified, if a disk is inserted
		while the requester is displayed, the return code would be 5.

		The DISKVALUE argument is required if either the DISKINSERTED
		or DISKREMOVED switches are specified.

Notes
-----
If EasyAsk is run on a system running Kickstart/Workbench Release 1.3 or
below, no requester will be displayed, no input will be accepted, and
the return code will be 20.

If the ABOUT switch is specified, the return code from EasyAsk will be 0.

If VALUES is specified, the number of gadgets exceeds the number of
return codes specified in VALUES, and the user selects a gadget for which
a return code is not specified in VALUES, the return code will be 20.

For example, if the command:

EasyAsk "Hello, world" "Ok|Goodbye|Hello" "0|5"

is given and the user selects the "Hello" gadget (for which no return
code is specified), the return code from EasyAsk will be 20.

This may have undesirable effects if the FAILAT value is set to values
greater than 20, as errors in coding of the script will behave like
valid user input. Recommendation: use care to verify that the GADGETS
and VALUES parameters are fully compatible.

Examples
--------
To create the following requester:

+---------------------+
|Easy Install         |
+---------------------+
|Insert SuperKickstart|
|diskette in DF0:     |
|                     |
|Ok	        Cancel|
+---------------------+

which will return 0 if "Ok" is selected or a disk is inserted and 20 if
"Cancel" is selected, use the following command:

EasyAsk "Insert SuperKickstart|diskette in DF0:" "Ok|Cancel" "0|20"
    TITLE "Easy Install" DISKINSERTED DISKVALUE 0

The following is an example script based on the above:

.bra {
.ket }
FAILAT 30 ;To avoid script termination if "Cancel" is selected by user
;Display requester and wait for user input
EasyAsk "Insert SuperKickstart|diskette in DF0:" "Ok|Cancel" "0|20"
    TITLE "Easy Install" DISKINSERTED DISKVALUE 0
;If "Cancel" is selected
IF FAIL
;	Display termination message
	echo "Installation aborted by user"
;	Exit
	quit
ENDIF
;If "Ok" is selected or disk is inserted
;Display status message
echo "Installing SuperKickstart"
;Install SuperKickstart
