                      Written by David N. Junod

Introduction

  This utility was designed for developers who are writing shared
  system libraries.  It allows a development, or debug, version of a
  library to be made available temporarily to its clients.

  It provides a means whereby a library can temporarily replace an
  existing shared system library with a debug version of the library.
  If there is symbol information within the debug version of the
  library, then the symbols and their current locations are shown in a
  list view.

  LibSwapper will only work with libraries that are Autoinit.


Usage

  This utility requires AmigaOS 2.x (or beyond) and can only be used
  from the shell.

  To invoke the utility, type from the shell:

    libswapper <libname>

  Where <libname> is the name of the library that contains symbols.
  For example:

    libswapper diskfont.ld

  Would invoke LibSwapper on a debug version of diskfont.library


Gadget Information

  The Library cycle gadget provides a way to swap the original and the
  debug library on the system library list.

  The text display gadget displays the name, version and revision of
  the library currently on the system library list.

  The upper listview displays the header and hunk information for the
  debug library.

  The lower listview displays the symbol information.  The first
  column is the hunk number, the second column is the name of the
  symbol and the third column is the address.


Technical Information

  Following is a summary of what LibSwapper does.  Note that the
  summary only follows the success path, even though LibSwapper does
  have a number of failure paths.


    o  LoadSeg() the library to be debugged.

    o  Search for the ROM tag.

    o  If the resident structure indicates that the executable is a
       library and autoinit, then performs MakeLibrary() and calls the
       rt_Init routine.

    o  Searches for rt_Name on the system shared library list.

    o  SetFunction() the LIB_EXPUNGE vector of the existing and debug
       library to a do-nothing expunge function.

    o  SetFunction() the LIB_OPEN and LIB_CLOSE vectors of the debug
       library so that the use count can be tracked by LibSwapper.

    o  Remove() the existing library from the list, and Enqueue() the
       debug library to the list.

    o  Open() the debug library to obtain hunk and symbol information
       for the list views.


Release Information

38.4 18-Feb-92

Added keyboard shortcuts.

   r	Reload library.
   ESC	Quit
   q	Quit

Now has a menu strip.

Added "Find Address".  Just key in a hex address and it will find the
label (useful for tracking down enforcer hits).


38.3 12-Feb-92

New for 38.3 is the ability to resize the window.  This allows for
more symbols to be shown when the screen size allows for it.

LibSwapper now uses file notification to see if the debug library has
changed.  Whenever the library changes, a requester will come up
asking if the library needs to be reloaded, ignore it, or if you want
to exit from LibSwapper.

Now doesn't insist that a version of the library already exist on the
system library list.

Change the Symbols listview to being selectable.  Helps keep your
place when looking at a symbol.

Shows number of LVO's, minus four (the standard ones).  Big woop, but
that is in preparation for doing something with them...
