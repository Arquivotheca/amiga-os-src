Using the 'flash' utility

FLASH is a tool for copying disk-like media to PCMCIA FlashROM cards.

Currently only the Intel FlashROM programming algorithim is supported.
In the future, algorithims for EEPROM, and Epson FlashROM may be
supported.  The Flash tool verifies that the FlashROM card you
insert returns the Intel identifier byte before it erases, or writes
to the card.

To create a readable disk, it makes the most sense to let a filesystem
figure out the proper disk structure for files, so FLASH does not
try to do this.   Rather, you can copy your files to a formatted
floppy disk, disk-like card, or ramdrive (RAD:).  To duplicate one
of these, do the following:


1.) Select SOURCE (trackdisk unit 0, carddisk unit 0, or ramdrive unit 0).

trackdisk unit 0 -

Refers to the built-in floppy drive.

	Advantages: No need for lots of card swapping.

	Disadvantages: Relatively slow (but not intolerable), and limited
	size (880K for standard density Amiga floppies).  Will not
	duplicate MS-DOS disks (requires a future option for mfm.device).


carddisk unit 0 -

Refers to use of the PCMCIA card slot, and a disk-like formatted card.

	Advantages: Allows for quick proto-typing on an SRAM card
	up to the maximum of 4 megabytes.  Can read MS-DOS like
	cards.

	Disadvantages: Painful because card swapping is required.
	The SRAM card must have a battery backup so it can be removed
	while the FlashROM card is being programmed.


ramdrive unit 0 -

Refers to use of ramdrive.device (RAD:).

	Advantages: Allows for quick duplication, and modifications
	of RAD: contents.  No card swapping required.

	Disadvantages: Requires the system have sufficient RAM to
	create a ramdrive disk as large as the FlashROM.  See
	special note below regarding the 'Install' option.



Binary File -

Not currently implemented.  In the future, this will copy a binary
file to FlashROM, or EEPROM, but also will require that the binary
file contain an appropriate Card Information Structure.

When copying from disklike media, the Flash tool will create an
appropriate disk-like Card Information Structure for you (based
on disk geometry, or in the case of the ramdrive, from the mountlist
entry).


2.) Select FlashROM speed.  250ns is the recommended default.  Consult
FlashROM documentation before selecting faster speeds.

3.) Select FlashROM total size.  There is a maximum of 4 megabytes,
which is all the A600 can support.

4.) Select FlashROM zone size.  Consult FlashROM documentation for this
information.  Simply put, zone size is the number of bytes which will
'potentially' be erased when the ERASE command is sent.  In actual
use, the ERASE command may be sent many times until the entire zone
is completely erased.


5.) Select type of card.  Currently only Intel FlashROM is supported.
In the future, EEPROM, and other flash rom types may be supported.


6.) There is generally no reason to turn off the "Erase Enable" option.
Doing so is only useful if you want to be warned that a FlashROM is
not already blank during the duplication process.  However you
may still use the "Full Erase" option to completely erase the card.

7.) Enable "Full Verify" for second pass verification.  While not
generally needed (since each byte is verified during writes),
the second pass is useful if you want the extra sense of security.

8.) The "Install" option is only available when duplicating from
the ramdrive.  This is required because it is not possible to
use the "C:Install" program to make the ramdrive bootable (the
ramdrive uses bootpoint booting, not bootblock booting like
floppies, and disk-like cards).  When enabled, a 2.0 style bootblock
is written to the first 2 disk blocks of the card.  The 3 byte
DOS type identifier is left unchanged.

9.) Select an action:

	Check Blank - checks every zone of the card to see if it
	is blank (every byte is $FF).

	Full Erase - Erases every zone of the card.  For Intel
	FlashROM, this includes writing 0's to the card, followed
	by erase.

	Program - Checks each zone of the card for blank state,
	erases the zone if it is not blank (unless you've
	disabled this feature), and prompts you as needed for
	the source, and destination media.

10.) The "Abort" gadget is enabled during any destructive operations,
such as Erase and Write operations.  It is currently not enabled during
read, and verify operations.  Aborting brings up a requester verifying
that you really want to abort.

11.) To quit, click on the window close gadget.
