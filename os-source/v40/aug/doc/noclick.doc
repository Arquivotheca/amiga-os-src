Turns off the "click" of empty floppy drives under 2.0.  Some very old
drives will continually click after application of this program.  These
drives ignore the electrical track zero sensor; upgrade drives or stop
using noclick.

PS: After this program is run, it will take one to five clicks before the
head has fully reached zero.  This is normal.
