CEDfixer is a patch program for CygnusEd users.  Its features are:

- adds a history buffer to the string gadget in the search requester

- allows the use of Amiga-C/W/F/O/L to change the state of the toggles
  in the search requester, or to leave it

- When you use CED's hot-start, and a requester is open on CED's
  screen, the topmost requester-window is activated (CED would only
  hot-start-activate its own window, which is silly when a blocking
  requester is up).  This only works when CED is running on its own
  screen.

Usage:
	run >NIL: cedfixer
