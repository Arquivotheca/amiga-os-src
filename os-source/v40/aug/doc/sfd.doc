	sfd -v				[determine version]
 
    FUNCTION
	sfd consumes files that describe a library's entry points
	and generates other files in different forms.
 
    INPUT
	_lib.sfd file - a file with the file suffix "_lib.sfd"
	    containing lines describing the library entry points:
 
	This file has the following format:
 
	SFD COMMANDS
 
	SFD Commands exist one to a line, introduced by the character
	string "==" at the beginning of the line, and extending to the
	end of the line.
 
	id: to describe the RCS Id string for the sfd file.  Required
	    to be the first line in the file.
	base: to describe the link address for the source for the
	    module a6 in the RAM/module/*.asm interfaces files, and the
	    offset off of a6 for the module a6 in the ROM/module/*.asm
	    interfaces.
		==base _ModuleBase
	    The offset is constructed from this: _ModuleBaseOffset
 
	include: to cause an #include to be generated for the
	    prototype file to resolve a typedef or #define used
	    to describe arguments to some of the functions.
		==include <graphics/gfx.h>
	    [This defines PLANEPTR for use by graphics functions]
	    
	bias: to start the function off
		==bias 30
	    This skips over Open/Close/Expunge/Reserved for libraries.
	    Use 42 for standard devices.
 
	alias: to alias a function.  The following function definition
	    keeps the bias of the previous one.
		LONG DoPkt( struct MsgPort *port, LONG action, LONG arg1,
			LONG arg2, LONG arg3, LONG arg4 ) (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6)
		==alias
		LONG DoPkt1( struct MsgPort *port, LONG action, LONG arg1 )
			(d1,d2,d3)
	    
	varargs: to introduce a varargs alias.  The following function
	    definition keeps the bias of the previous one, and includes
	    a prototype with one instance of the varargs parameter,
	    followed by ...
		struct Menu *CreateMenusA( struct NewMenu *newmenu,
			struct TagItem *taglist ) (A0,A1)
		==varargs
		struct Menu *CreateMenus( struct NewMenu *newmenu,
			Tag tag1, ... ) (A0,A1)
 
	    The above form generates a prototype that requires the
	    existence of the first varargs argument (in this case,
	    'tag1').   Certain varargs functions such as printf()
	    type functions don't necessarily require any variable
	    arguments.  For such functions, omit the argument.
	    However, the register must still be supplied.

		LONG VFPrintf( BPTR fh,
			UBYTE *format, LONG *argarray ) (d1,d2,d3)
		==varargs
		LONG FPrintf( BPTR fh,
			 UBYTE *format, ... ) (d1,d2,d3)


	    SAS 6 supports a "pragma tagcall" directive, and sfd
	    will emit these, enclosed in an #ifdef __SASC_60, since
	    earlier versions of the SAS compiler do not like the
	    pragma tagcall lines.

	    Note: as of the current release of SAS 6, printf-style
	    varargs functions can't use pragma tagcall since the
	    compiler doesn't like the omission of the last parameter.
	    Therefore, generation of such pragma tagcall lines is
	    suppressed.

	private: to declare the following functions as system use only,
	    and hide them somewhat.  No prototypes nor RAM/module/*.asm
	    interfaces are built.  Pragmas are prefixed with a note that
	    the function is private.  Comments inside a ==private section
	    are omitted from the prototypes file.
		==private
	    NB:  The .fd file contains the full private information.
 
	public: to declare the following functions for general use.
		==public
 
	reserve: to reserve space in the function table without
	    generating *any* symbols.  Comments are placed in the
	    _lib.fd, _pragmas.h, and _protos.h files, and the .fd
	    file has a ##bias generated for the next function entry.
	    If a _lib.i file is being created (with the -i option),
	    FUNCDEF macros are generated for the names moduleReservedNN,
	    where NN is the -bias of the reserved entry.
		==reserve 2
	    reserves two function slots.
 
	    This is preferred over private/function-declaration/public
	    as a way to skip over reserved entry points that have no
	    meaning.
 
	version: to describe the version of the module that subsequent
	    functions appear in.  This causes comments to be generated
	    in _lib.fd, _pragmas.h, and _protos.h files.
		==version 33
	    this causes the following comment in the .fd file and similar
	    ones in the pragma & proto files:
	    *--- functions in V33 or higher (distributed as Release 1.2) ---
 
	end: to declare the end of the sfd file.  Required.
		==end
 
 
	COMMENTS
 
	Comments are any line starting with a "*", and last to the
	end of the line.
 
		* this is a comment.
 
	They are converted to comments in the _lib.fd, _pragmas.h,
	and _protos.h files.
	o   .fd comments are identical to .sfd comments
	o   .h comments use the following rules
	    o   a "/" is prepended to the line
	    o   if the second character is a blank or a tab, the
		line is appended with " *\", otherwise, it is
		appended with "*\".
	
 
	FUNCTION DEFINITION
 
	Anything that is not an sfd command or a comment must be
	part of a function definition.  A function definition
	consists of three parts: the return value/function part,
	the parameter definition, and the register definition:
	    <return/function>(<parameters>)(<registers>)
	All three parts must be present.  They may cross lines.
	A particular function definition is terminated by the
	second close paranthesis.  A function definition must
	start on a fresh line.
 
	    EXAMPLES
		VOID OpenIntuition() ()
 
		o   Even an empty parameter list needs an empty register
		    list.
		o   The C types void, unsigned, int, short, char, float
		    and double are not allowed.  Use VOID, [U]LONG,
		    [U]WORD, [U]BYTE, FLOAT or DOUBLE.  Use APTR, not VOID *.
		o   Don't put a VOID in an empty parameter list.
		    Currently, the sfd tool will put one there for you.
 
		PLANEPTR AllocRaster( UWORD width, UWORD height ) (D0,D1)
 
		o   The sfd tool must be taught about all-caps primitive
		    types.  It knows about BPTR, BSTR, STRPTR, IX, and
		    PLANEPTR so far.
		o   The parameter list must contain typed variables.
		o   The register list is generally delimited by commas.
		    The sfd tool figures out which to cluster for the
		    resulting _lib.fd file.
 
		DOUBLE IEEEDPDiv( DOUBLE dividend, DOUBLE divisor )
			(d0-d1,d2-d3)
 
		o   The function definition can cross lines.
		o   DOUBLE registers must be delimited by a dash.
		o   The register list may use either capital or lower case.
 
		struct Layer *CreateUpfrontLayer(struct Layer_Info *li,
			struct BitMap *bm, LONG x0, LONG y0, LONG x1, LONG y1,
			LONG flags, [struct BitMap *bm2] )
			(A0,A1,D0,D1,D2,D3,D4,A2)
 
		o   Optional parameters are indicated by being enclosed
		    in braces.  Admittedly, the sfd tool currently
		    outputs the same results as if they were not there,
		    but we can change that by changing the tool if we
		    decide to.  Changing the tool instead of changing
		    the input is an important concept.
 
		struct Window *OpenWindowTagList( struct NewWindow *newWindow,
			struct TagItem *tagList ) (A0,A1)
		==varargs
		struct Window *OpenWindowTags( struct NewWindow *newWindow,
			ULONG tag1Type, ... ) (A0,A1)
		
		o   The only time ... may appear is for a varargs definition.
		o   A varargs definition must have one instance of the type.
