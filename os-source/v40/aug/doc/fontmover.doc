ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Release   (9/29/90)

Well, the FontMover has not changed at all (other than some text)
plus a relink with a fixed CompairLocks() routine to help make
sure that there are not enforcer hits.  (CompairLocks was not
checking for the NULL lock...)

This is my release 2.0 of the FontMover...  Guess all we can do now
is wait...

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Beta 5    (6/9/90)  A.K.A. "DevCon Beta"

Well, this is the one that should make it on the disks for DevCon.
I'm not going to touch it again until after DevCon...

                          -- Mike

A few very minor changes:

Font preview has changed such that if the font is larger than the
preview area the baseline of the font will be at the base of the
preview area.  This lets very large fonts display better with lower
case characters.  (Great suggestion...)

Found one possible interface problem as far a layout is concerned.  I
was assuming that the '<' and '>' characters were of the same size.
I did not find a font that showed differenly, but I fixed it anyway.
Now uses the larger of the two sizes when laying out the directory
select gadgets.

A few minor changes to the strings in the program.

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Beta 4a   (6/3/90)

Just relinked with the fixed RenderInfo...  (Minor bug in
RenderInfo on it telling me the size of the bottom border.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Beta 4    (6/2/90)

The FontMover grew a bit this time.  Most of it is due to the fact
that I have added large amounts of text for the help screens.  Things
are starting to look done.

I have added a pixel between the action gadgets in the main
window.  It is only a one-line change in the source, so if you
think it looks worse this way I can change it back with little
trouble.  I think it looks better this way one interlaced screens
and still looks good on non-interlaced screens.

The directory requester now sports a HELP gadget.  It always had
help available, but now I have a gadget there too.  (Help was
available from the keyboard via the HELP key or '?' or 'H')

The directory requester feels a bit different now.  This is due to
some input I got from floppy-only users.  In the old directory
requester, if you selected a directory you would click on it and
the requester would go out and scan the disk for sub-directories
within it.  This sounds fine except that if the directory you
clicked on was the one you wanted the requester will scan the disk
and then when you press OK the FontMover would need to scan it
again to load the ".font" files.  Now, when you single-click on
an item it just highlights.  If you select OK at this time, it will
return that directory to the FontMover for loading of ".font"
files.  If you double-click on the directory, the requester will
then scan that directory and display the sub-directories.  It is
a bit of a different "feel" but I think it is a much better
design for those with not-so-blindingly-fast drives.  In addition,
this new operation made the feature below possible in the
directory requester.

I have also added full keyboard support.  I know that it was mostly
there before, but now you can control the list gadgets too.  This
feature is rather interesting.  All together it cost about 300 bytes
of code to add.

In the main screen, you can press an up/down arrow along with a
qualifier to specify the list you wish to control.  The qualifiers
are as follows:

LEFT-SHIFT-arrow	- Controls the LEFT font name list
LEFT-ALT-arrow		- Controls the LEFT font size list

RIGHT-SHIFT-arrow	- Controls the RIGHT font name list
RIGHT-ALT-arrow		- Controls the RIGHT font size list

In the directory requester, there are no qualifiers and the up/down
arrows work on the one list item.  Double-click from the keyboard is
done via the SPACEBAR.

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Beta 3    (5/27/90)

Gee, I have been busy!  I was about to upload the Beta 2 (morning of
the 26th) and could not get into BIX.  So, I started to code.  I have
not left this seat other than for a quick dinner since about 5AM last
morning.

Major code clean up, including the fact that all strings are now gotten
via a single function call into FontMoverStrings.c file.  This
will make it easier to do internationalization now by just letting me
replace that one object file.  The next step is to use the new
localization library that Commodore is designing.  The way the code is
set up now, this should be just a dropin...  (Just add the call ;-)

Spent the last 6 hours cleaning up and re-activating the full font
sensitive code and adding the font fall-back code.  (That is, if the
window can not be opened with the font size given, it will try again
with TOPAZ-8 font for as much of the window as possible.)  This makes
the program runnable in more casses than before (albeit that it may
look a bit strange having it run with a Bev-52 font and TOPAZ-8 for
most of the gadgets...)

The font sensitivity code was both easy and hard.  There are a few
very subtle cases that were hard to deal with correctly.  I hope that
I did not miss any.  (Try guessing all of the cases.  Maybe I will
hold a contest where the best guess wins something...)

No bug fixes that I know of as I have not release beta 2...  ;-)

Please really bang on this with all sorts of fonts.  I need to make
sure that it will work in most/all cases.

                        -- Mike

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Beta 2    (5/26/90)

Well, I have gone through the code and found all of the non-message
error tests (places where I had checked for error and did the right
thing but did not tell the user)

Added the suggestion that the FontMover tell of any auto font type
converstions it may need to do during the moving of the fonts.

Cleaned up the code a bit and got it ready for the next major step.

Changes from Beta-1

FontCopy now tells the user when two fonts are of different type and
	that it had to change the types to the basic compatible type.

FontCopy now handles remote fonts as the destination too.  This is done
	by looking at the first size in the list.  If there is a font
	size there, the new font size will be placed in the same
	directory that the first font in the list is.  Thus, if a font
	is a remote font and you are adding a new font to it, that new
	size will be placed in the same directory.

Low memory and other errors that prevent the opening of a the FontMover
	requesters now generate a recoverable alert which will tell the
	user what is happening.  These alerts, in 2.0, are GREEN.  In
	AmigaDOS 1.3 they are still RED and thus may cause some "worry"
	since it looks something like a GURU.  However, the alert does
	its best to NOT look like a GURU.

More error messages have been added.  In all of the places where I had
	a comment such as "We should tell the user about this" or
	"Tell user requester could not open" there is now either a
	requester or an Alert.

Moved all of the text definitions into one file.

Many changes to some of my library code.  (This includes the ListGadget
	and such) that should reduce the size of the code a bit.  One
	change also lets me do better fall-back to TOPAZ80 if the
	default font is too large.  (This is mainly for the ListGadget)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Beta 1    (5/14/90)

(Gee, it is getting late...  Is it Monday already!?!?)

Well, all of the functional parts of the FontMover are in...  (I think)
I even have a few of the HELP texts done.  Their may be a few more
buttons added (mainly HELP gadgets in the requesters) but otherwise
all is there.

Please pound of this one and if you come up with some good help text,
let me know.  It looks like the HELP text will be a major cost in size
but also should be a great benefit.

I have the code in there to be able to do CONTEXT sensitive help from
the MAIN WINDOW.  (Other requesters have other help routines)
So, for example, the help routine could tell if you have any font
directories loaded and if you have selected any font or font size.
Thus, if there are two directories loaded and a font selected, the
text could show that the font selected could be COPIED from / to.
Or that the font could be REMOVED or what would be shown.  (Guess
this needs to be worked out...)

Until next time...
                          -- Mike
            (Now ducking into the shower to get ready for work)

BUG Fixes from Alpha-1

FindName() is case sensitive and that messed up a copy when the
	destination font was already there but in a different case.
	So, I had to write FindIName()

The mixing of RAWKEY and VANNILAKEY did not work too well as I was
	using the UP in RAWKEY and VANNILAKEY did the down.  So,
	in a requester, if you pressed ESC and did not release it
	before the requester went away, the UP RAWKEY ESC was seen
	and the program exited.  Now everything is working with
	RAWKEY and RawKeyConvert()

The ListGadget code I was using (MKSoft ListGadget) had a small problem
	in that if given a font too large it would bomb.  Now, it
	will revert to TOPAZ80.

The ListGadget code I was using had a problem with Requesters.  I had
	forgotten to set the REQGADGET in all of the sub-gadgets.
	(ACK!  This was a *STUPID* one!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ICAD Group FontMover V2.0 Alpha 1   (5/6/90)

Well, the core of the FontMover is now in place.  All of the true
FontMover features have been connected to the buttons.  Still missing
is the "Directory Requester" to help the user find his fonts
directories and the HELP text.  (The code is there, just need to put in
the text.)  Also missing is the text for many of the error sitiuations.
All errors should be handled correctly, (other than those which are
bugs in 1.3 such as Close()) however, many may not give a report.
Again, just need to place the call to the message routine.  The routine
is done.

Please test this in your system.  (Joanne - There still is the problem
of paths over 255 characters, but that is within the '.font' file
itself...  Sorry... ;-)

Please test this in 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0 systems, with various Font and
Colour selections.

Please E-Mail or post in ICAD any bugs.

Thank you...
                      -- Mike

FontMover 2.0 Documentation (Very, very preliminary)

FontMover is a utility that assists in managing your Amiga fonts.  The
FontMover will let you copy fonts from one directory to another, remove
a font from a directory, and display a sample of the font.

FontMover will correctly maintain the ".font" index files for the font
directories.  It will not generate missing ".font" files as this is the
job of the FixFonts program.  If you always use the FontMover to manage
your fonts, you should never need to use FixFonts.

The FontMover knows how to deal with the various ".font" types that are
showing up in the system since 1.3.  (There have been a few types since
the early 1.4 alpha and beta releases and the new 2.0 beta release of
the Amiga OS)  In the event that you are adding a font to an existing
family, the FontMover will make sure that they are of compatible type.
If not, the FontMover will modify them to match in a compatible way.
This also means that the FontMover can, while in 1.3, see and move a
font that 1.3 Diskfont.library can not open.

There is full keyboard control in the program:

Pressing RETURN in the main window will make the first string gadget
active.  Pressing return fron it will make the second string gadget
active.  Pressing "1" will activate the first string gadget.  Pressing
"2" will activate the second string gadget.  Pressing "SHIFT-1" or
"SHIFT-2" will load FONTS: into that string gadget and load that
list.

To control the list gadgets (that is, move the highlight bar in them)
you use the arrow keys.  In the main window there are four list
gadgets.  These are controller via the arrow keys based on the
keyboard qualifier used in conjunction with them.  They are:

LEFT-SHIFT-arrow	- Controls the LEFT font name list
LEFT-ALT-arrow		- Controls the LEFT font size list

RIGHT-SHIFT-arrow	- Controls the RIGHT font name list
RIGHT-ALT-arrow		- Controls the RIGHT font size list

In the directory requester the arrow keys control the list gadget
without any special qualifiers.  The SPACEBAR signifies a
'double-click' on the current active line.

Pressing RETURN in the Directory requester will activate the string
gadget.  Pressing RETURN in the Create Directory requester will
activate the string gadget.

To UN-Activate a string gadget without causing the next action,
press the RIGHT-SHIFT-RIGHT-AMIGA keys together.  This is the same
as taping on the MENU mouse button.

In most parts of the program, the first character of the gadget is
also a keyboard shortcut.  However, in the directory requester, the
CANCEL and CREATE gadgets caused problems and thus "C" is for CREATE
and "N" or ESC is for CANCEL.

In cases other than in HELP or ERROR displays, the user can press the
HELP key (or '?' or 'H') for information.

When a requester is up, you can press the first character of the
gadgets or ESC for cancel/negative.

If you get a requester that shows MORE and DONE, the DONE gadget will
exit while the MORE gadget will continue with more of the text.
(Since the requester text uses the Screen font, the times when you get
a MORE gadget would depent on how much text can fit in your situation.)

Also, you can press Y for the positive gadget and N for the negative
gadget.
