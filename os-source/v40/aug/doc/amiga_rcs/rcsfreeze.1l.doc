NAME
     rcsfreeze - freeze a configuration  of  sources  checked  in
     under RCS

SYNOPSIS
     rcsfreeze [symbolic revision name]

DESCRIPTION
     The _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e command has the purpose of  assigning  a  sym-
     bolic  revision  number  to a set of RCS files, which form a
     valid configuration.

     The idea is to run _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e each  time  a  new  version  is
     checked  in.  A  unique  symbolic revision number (C__n_u_m_b_e_r,
     where _n_u_m_b_e_r is increased each time  rcsfreeze  is  run)  is
     then  assigned  to the most recent revision of each RCS file
     of the main trunk.

     If the command is invoked with an argument, then this  argu-
     ment is used as the symbolic name to freeze a configuration.
     The unique identifier is still generated and  is  listed  in
     the  log file but it will not appear as part of the symbolic
     revision name in the actual RCS files.

     A log message is requested from the user which is saved  for
     future references.

     The shell script works only on all RCS files  at  one  time.
     It is important that all changed files are checked in (there
     are no precautions against any error in this  respect).  Run
     _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n(1L) first and see whether any sources remain in the
     current directory.

FILES
     [RCS/]rcsfreeze.version  for the version number

     [RCS/]rscfreeze.log      for the log messages,  most  recent
                              log message first.

     checked out and modified.
