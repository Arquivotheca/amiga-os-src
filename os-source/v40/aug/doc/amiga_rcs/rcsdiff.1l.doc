NAME
     rcsdiff - compare RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     rcsdiff [ -biwt ] [ -cefhn ] [ -q ] [ -r_r_e_v_1 ]  [  -r_r_e_v_2  ]
     file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_c_s_d_i_f_f runs _d_i_f_f(1) to compare two revisions  of  each  RCS
     file given.  A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name,
     otherwise a working file name. _R_c_s_d_i_f_f derives  the  working
     file  name  from  the  RCS  file  name  and  vice  versa, as
     explained in _c_o(1L).  Pairs consisting of both an RCS and  a
     working file name may also be specified.

     The options -b, -i, -w, -t, -c, -e, -f,  and  -h,  have  the
     same  effect as described in _d_i_f_f(1); option -n generates an
     edit script of the  format  used  by  RCS.   The  option  -q
     suppresses diagnostic output.

     If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2  are  omitted,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares  the
     latest  revision on the default branch (normally the highest
     branch on the trunk) with the contents of the  corresponding
     working  file.  This  is  useful  for  determining  what you
     changed since the last checkin.

     If _r_e_v_1 is given, but  _r_e_v_2  is  omitted,  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f  compares
     revision  _r_e_v_1  of  the  RCS  file  with the contents of the
     corresponding working file.

     If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are given, _r_c_s_d_i_f_f compares  revisions
     _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of the RCS file.

     Both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 may be given numerically or symbolically,
     and may actually be attached to any of the options.

EXAMPLES
     The command

             rcsdiff  f.c

     runs _d_i_f_f on the latest revision on the  default  branch  of
     RCS file f.c,v and the contents of working file f.c.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status is 0 if there were no differences during the
     last comparison, 1 if there were differences, and 2 if there
     were errors.
