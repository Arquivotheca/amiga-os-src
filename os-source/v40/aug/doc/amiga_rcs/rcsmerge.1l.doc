NAME
     rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     rcsmerge -r_r_e_v_1 [ -r_r_e_v_2 ] [ -p ] file

DESCRIPTION
     _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e incorporates the changes between _r_e_v_1 and  _r_e_v_2  of
     an  RCS  file  into the corresponding working file. If -p is
     given, the result is printed on the standard output,  other-
     wise the result overwrites the working file.

     A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise  a
     working  file name. _M_e_r_g_e derives the working file name from
     the RCS file name and vice versa, as explained in _c_o(1L).  A
     pair  consisting  of both an RCS and a working file name may
     also be specified.

     _R_e_v_1 may not be omitted. If  _r_e_v_2  is  omitted,  the  latest
     revision  on the default branch (normally the highest branch
     on the trunk) is assumed.  Both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 may  be  given
     numerically or symbolically.

     _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e prints a warning if there are overlaps, and  delim-
     its the overlapping regions as explained in _c_o -_j.  The com-
     mand is useful for incorporating changes into a  checked-out
     revision.

EXAMPLES
     Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of f.c. Assume furth-
     ermore  that  you  just  completed  revision  3.4,  when you
     receive updates to release 2.8 from someone else.   To  com-
     bine  the  updates  to  2.8 and your changes between 2.8 and
     3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

             rcsmerge  -p  -r2.8  -r3.4  f.c  >f.merged.c

     Then examine f.merged.c.  Alternatively, if you want to save
     the  updates  to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as revi-
     sion 2.8.1.1 and execute _c_o -_j:

             ci  -r2.8.1.1  f.c
             co  -r3.4  -j2.8:2.8.1.1  f.c

     As another example, the following command undoes the changes
     between  revision  2.4 and 2.8 in your currently checked out
     revision in f.c.

             rcsmerge  -r2.8  -r2.4  f.c

     Note the order of  the  arguments,  and  that  f.c  will  be
     overwritten.
