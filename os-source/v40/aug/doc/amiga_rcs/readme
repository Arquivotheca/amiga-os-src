These 2 disks contain the sources and executable to a port of RCS to the
Amiga from Unix. The port was done by Raymond S. Brand and Rick Schaeffer.

Installation:
	Set your stack to 20000 or more.
	Create a directory for the RCS executables and in your startup-
sequence, assign RCS: to that directory. You may alos want to add RCS: to
your path. Copy the files from the bin directory on disk 1 to the RCS
directory. Add 'SetEnv USERNAME xxxx' to your startup-sequence, where xxxx
is replaced by what you want RCS to think your user id is. Your user id
may not contain any of the following characters; " ", "$", ",", ".", ":",
";", "@".
	Read the documentation in the doc directory of disk 1.

RCS_link:
	If the file "RCS_link" exists in the current directory, then
the RCS tools  will look in this file for the path name of the RCS
directory.  So, if your RCS files are in foo:local/src/foobar/RCS and
you are in your local directory of hd6:joker/foobar then the RCS_link
file in your current directory should contain:

	"foo:local/src/foobar/RCS/\n"

The RCS_link may either an absolute or a relative path but must end with
a ":" or a "/" followed by a linefeed. The RCS_link feature is a rather
late addition to the code and therefor has had rather limited testing.

Warning:
	The business of RCS is the manipulation of source files. We believe
that the software has no serious bugs but you should make plenty of backups
of your files (at least) until you are sure this software works for you.

Todo:
	Port the rcsfreeze and rcsclean scripts to the Amiga. Cleanup the
code sections labeled TODO.

Bugs:
	If you find any, please send a descriptive note Ray and/or Rick at
the addresses below.
