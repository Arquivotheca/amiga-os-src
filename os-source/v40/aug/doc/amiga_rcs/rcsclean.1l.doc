NAME
     rcsclean - clean up working files

SYNOPSIS
     rcsclean [ -r_r_e_v ] [ -q_r_e_v ] file...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_c_s_c_l_e_a_n removes working files that  were  checked  out  and
     never  modified.  For each file given, _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n compares the
     working file and a revision in the corresponding  RCS  file.
     If it finds no difference, it removes the working file, and,
     if the revision was locked by the caller, unlocks the  revi-
     sion.

     A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise  a
     working  file  name.  _R_c_s_c_l_e_a_n derives the working file name
     from the RCS file name  and  vice  versa,  as  explained  in
     _c_o(1L).   Pairs consisting of both an RCS and a working file
     name may also be specified.

     _R_e_v specifies with which revision the working file  is  com-
     pared.   If  _r_e_v  is  omitted, _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n compares the working
     file with the latest revision on the  default  branch  (nor-
     mally  the  highest  branch  on  the  trunk).  The option -q
     suppresses diagnostics.

     _R_c_s_c_l_e_a_n is useful for "clean" targets in  Makefiles.   Note
     that  _r_c_s_d_i_f_f(1L)  prints out the differences.  Also, _c_i(1L)
     normally asks whether to check in  a  file  if  it  was  not
     changed.

EXAMPLES
     The command

          rcsclean *.c *.h

     removes all working files ending in ".c" or ".h"  that  were
     not changed since their checkout.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status is 0 if there were no differences during the
     last comparison or if the last working file did not exist, 1
     if there were differences, and 2 if there were errors.
