   NAME
	CPUSpeed

   SYNOPSIS
	CPUSpeed - Test and compair the speed of your CPU with A2000 & A3000

   FUNCTION
	To show the performance of your CPU as compaired to the CPU in
	stock A2000 and A3000/25 machines.

	This is a simple CPU performance test program.  It tests
	both integer and floating point performance.

	The tests are run in a standard system so that running the
	tests while other tasks are running will result in lower
	numbers.

	The Integer math test tests the performance of the CPU
	doing integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
	division along with a few load and store operations.  The
	number displayed as the result is the number of operations
	per second.  This is an average as divide takes longer than
	addition.  There are an equal number of the four operations
	in the test loop.  Over 24,576,000 operations are done in
	the test in order to produce reasonably accurate results.
	The operations are done on a table of numbers and thus
	produce a rather wide range of operands.

	The Floating point math test tests the performance of the
	FPU/CPU combination in doing floating point math.  The loop
	contains basic floating point instructions (no
	transcendental instructions) and does over 20,736,000
	instructions (including a few load and store with
	rounding).  There are also 5,760,000 integer load/store
	instructions executed in an attempt to make the code less
	of a "fixed" test.

	Both of the test loops operate on a table of source values
	that is 4096-bytes in size.  This means that the data cache
	only helps in the burst loading of the values from memory.
	The code is also an unrolled loop as to break the cache as
	much as possible.

	The values given on the result graph are the number of
	operations per second.  For the floating point side, that
	is FLOPS (floating point operations per second) and on the
	integer side, it is IMADS (integer multiplications and
	divisions per second).

   INPUTS
