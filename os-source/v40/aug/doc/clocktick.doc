ClockTick - A simple hack that makes any busy pointer that matches the
            Kickstart 2.0 clock pointer move its hands.


To use:  Just add ClockTick to your startup.

When you execute the ClockTick program, it will check to see if it has
been installed and if not, it will install itself.  To install itself,
ClockTick allocates 865 bytes of memory (well, 872 bytes since you round
to 8 byte chunks) and connects itself to the SetPointer() call of
intuition.  From then on, all programs which SetPointer() a pointer that
looks like the 2.0 busy pointer will be noticed and the animated pointer
will be used.  The ClockTick program exits after it is installed.
It does not add a task to the system.  (Thus the low overhead)

ClockTick works from the CLI or Workbench (icon included)
