    NAME
	fixlace - fix the Intuition vs. Graphics interlace bug


    FUNCTION
	If you run *any* mix of interlaced and non-interlaced screens,
	you are vulnerable to this bug.  With a flicker-fixer type device
	in this system, a mix is very common.

	Run fixlace and your problems go away.

    EXAMPLE
	Don't belive in the bug?  Try this:

		1> Start an interlaced Workbench.
		2> Open an interlaced screen, push to back.
		3> Open a non-interlace screen, push to back.
		4> Push workbench to back.
		5> Push screen to back.
		6> boom.

	At step 4 you should see your interlaced screen without the
	interlace.

    BUGS
	There should be "negative one" bugs in this funciton.
