   NAME
	MapBoard - A 68040 Expansion Board ROM mapper

   SYNOPSIS
	MapBoard will let you map the ROM of an I/O board as cacheable
	at specific addresses on 68040 systems.

   FUNCTION
	MapBoard will use the MMU to map sections of an I/O board's
	address space as cacheable such that things like device drivers
	can run in the CPU instruction caches.  No memory should be
	used by this program.

	This program only is useful for 68040 based systems running
	V37.10 or later of the 68040.library.

	All options are also available from icon tooltypes in either
	project or tool icons.

   INPUTS
	MANUFACTURE/N	- The Manufacture autoconfig ID for the board

	PRODUCT/N	- The Product autoconfig ID for the board

	OFFSET/N	- The address offset from the start of the board
			  where caching should begin.  This is rounded up
			  to the nearest page address.

	SIZE/N		- The length in bytes of the cacheable area.
			  This will be rounded to the page size as
			  to only cache pages that are completely
			  contained within the area from OFFSET to
			  OFFSET+SIZE

	A2091/S		- Do the Commodore-Amiga A2091 hard drive
			  controller ROM.  This makes the A2091
			  run over 10 times faster on the A4000
			  when talking to non-DMA memory.

   RESULTS
	The MMU tables are modified to show the specific pages as
	cacheable.  MapBoard does not (currently) produce any error
	messages.

   WARNING
	Specifying invalid SIZE or OFFSET can cause the hardware device
	to fail.  MapBoard does not any specific knowledge of the hardware
	you are mapping (other than the A2091) and thus can not error
	check your input.

   NOTES
	Since this tool modifies the existing MMU tables, toys that play
	with the MMU can cause it to not work.  MapBoard will correctly
	ignore invalid MMU tables as best it can.  The tables must be
	4K page size and be fully valid 68040 tables.

	Also, since Enforcer and such tools install a new MMU table
	when they run, you will need to run MapBoard after starting
	Enforcer.  If you quit Enforcer and then restart Enforcer
	you will need to run MapBoard again.  If you run MapBoard
	before Enforcer, Enforcer will correctly restore the MMU
	settings when it quits.  So, if you ever do run Enforcer and
	turn it off you may wish to have MapBoard run BEFORE you
	run Enforcer and after each time you start Enforcer.
