SetWorkBench - A 2.0 Workbench Untility hack by Michael Sinz

*NEW* Version that fixes a problem with the old version and the new
2.03 Workbench...  (Actually, two problems :-)

This hack only works in 2.0 and may not continue to work beyond
2.0 of the OS.  It is not supported in any way and may break at
any time.

What SetWorkBench does is give you CLI support for sizing the
workbench window and for cleaning it up.  This can be very usefull
if you normally want your workbench window at a certain place on
the screen. (A2024 and Moniterm users will love this...)

Usage:  SetWorkBench [LEFT x] [TOP y] [WIDTH w] [HEIGHT h] [CLEANUP] [WAIT]

If no parameters are given, it will display the current workbench
window's x/y position and its size.

If any sizing or position parameters are given, the window will be sized
to the new values.  Any value that is not given will not be changed
from that of the current window.

The CLEANUP keyword will cause workbench to do a CLEANUP.  Note that in
order to do this, SetWorkBench needs to wait until workbench is
truly up and running.  Thus, this option also causes the SetWorkBench
program to not exit until workbench is completely started.  This can
be usefull on floppies when combined with the WAIT keyword.

	NOTE:  Since sizing a window is ASYNC, doing a CLEANUP
	and sizing the window in the same command after workbench
	is already up and running may cause the cleanup to happen
	before the sizing event is completed.

The WAIT keyword will cause SetWorkBench to wait until the workbench
window is opened.  This is needed if you use SetWorkBench from
a script that also does the LoadWB command.  It can also be used to
reduce disk trashing.

Example section of my startup script on a A2024 monitor running in
A2024 mode.  (This is 1008x800 display)

;
; This is a hack that moves the workbench window to "my" position
;
Run >NIL: SetWorkbench >NIL: LEFT 506 WIDTH 502 HEIGHT 386 CLEANUP WAIT
;
; Startup WorkBench...
;
LoadWB >NIL:
;

Note that I do not specify the top position as I do not need it changed
from the initial window.  Also, note that since this is on a harddrive
system, I do not really want to wait for SetWorkBench to finish
before other things happen in the script.

For a floppy system, to cause the script to wait for workbench to be
loaded and reduce disk thrashing, try the following:

startup-sequence:

  .
  .
  .
NewCLI >NIL: FROM S:StartUp-Continue
LoadWB >NIL:
EndCLI >NIL:



startup-continue:

SetWorkBench >NIL: WAIT CLEANUP
  .
  .
  .
