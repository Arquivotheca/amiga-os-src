ASDemo - Attached Screens Demo

Versatile program to demonstrate or test attached screens under V38
Intuition.  It opens a window (which it generally keeps on the front
screen) and lists all open Intuition screens.  It allows sample
screens and child screens to be opened or closed.

Here is what each button does:

"To Front" - Calls ScreenToFront() on currently selected screen.

"To Back" - Calls ScreenToBack() on currently selected screen.

"Open New Front" - Opens a new screen in front

"Open New Back" - Opens a new screen in the rear

"Add Child Front" - If the selected screen was created by asdemo, and
	is not itself a child of another screen, open a child of that
	screen in front.

"Add Child Back" - If the selected screen was created by asdemo, and
	is not itself a child of another screen, open a child of that
	screen in the rear.

"Close Screen" - Close the selected screen (if it was created by asdemo and
	currently has no children)

"Refresh List" - Refresh the screen list.

NB: Graphics.library 38.2 sometimes crashes when an interlaced screen
is closed!
