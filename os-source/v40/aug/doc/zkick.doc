-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	ZKick 2.01 fixes a bug which caused ZKick not to work with most
autoboot controllers. 

	ZKick is a KickStart 2.0 kickfile loader, similar to KickIt by Bryce
Nesbitt, but with several advantages.  First of all, ZKick will work in ANY
Amiga with a ram board at $200000, no matter which slot it's in.  Second,
when ZKick loads KickStart, it survives a reboot!  When you hit CTRL-AMIGA-
AMIGA, you are placed back in KickStart 2.0.  This feature can be disabled
with the "-die" option.

Requirements:

	1)  Total memory must be 1.5M or greater.
	2)  There must be a 512k or greater ram board at location $200000.

Usage:

	ZKick [-die] kickfile

The -die option is used to tell ZKick not to survive reboots, so that when
the machine is reset, the KickStart ROM will be run instead.

Also included is the program KillZKick.  KillZKick removes ZKick from
memory, and reboots the system with the KickStart ROM.

Special  thanks  to Dan Babcock for sending me an excellent article that he
wrote  which  showed how to set up RomTag modules correctly, as well as his
many ideas for bug fixes and improvements.

P.S.  This is my first attempt at assembler programming on the 68000.
      I hope you enjoy the results!!!
