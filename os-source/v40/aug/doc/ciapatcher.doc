CIA Patcher
-----------

This program adjusts certain applications that use one of the special Amiga
timer chips in a manner incompatible with AmigaDOS 2.0. The special timer chip
is known as the CIA-A chip, and CIAPatcher changes the applications so they
use the CIA-B chip instead. The majority of programs CIAPatcher will help are
Music and MIDI-related applications.

When used from the CLI, simply provide the name of the application to correct
on the command-line. A new application will be created in the same directory
as the original, but with the extension '.patched'.

When using Workbench, simply drag the icons of defective applications onto the
CIAPatcher. A copy of the icon will then be created with the extension
'.patched' tacked onto the end of the name. This new icon will contain a
corrected version of the application.

A note for SONIX users. In order to function under AmigaDOS 2.0, SONIX must be
patched by CIAPatcher. The main SONIX program does not need the patch. Instead
a file called "sonix.code" located in the Miscellaneous drawer must be
patched.

This program can only be used under AmigaDOS 2.0
