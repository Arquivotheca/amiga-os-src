 * FixNames - Takes a volume name and a script file name and produces
 *	      Two scripts - A "'script'.makesafe" and "'script'.restore"
 *
 *	      The scripts will rename the files on the system that contain
 *	      European characters and rename them to "__SafeFile #__" name
 *	      which, after the new OS is installed, will be renamed back
 *	      to the original names.

The new filesystem:

	The current version of the filesystem supports switching two modes
	of handling extended ASCII characters.	The old mode, and the
	current default, is to treat characters like ö and Ö as different.
	The new mode treats upper and lower case extended characters the
	same.  The mode may be toggled with "toggle_international_mode".

Reason for fixnames:

	Old files that contain extended characters may calculate to a
	different "hash" value.  In simple terms, some old files with
	extended characters can't be read when the filesystem is in the new
	mode.

	This program produces two scripts.  The first script renames all of
	the files that contain any of these characters into a safe name and
	the other renames the safe name files back to the original name.
	Thus, you would run this program to produce the scripts, execute
	the first script, turn on the new filesystem international
	character support, and then execute the second script.

Errors in second script:

	It is possible that you might get an error message in the second
	script.  This is due to the fact that a file name exists with upper
	and lower case versions of it.	Since in the old filing system
	these were two different files, there was no problem.  However, now
	that they are the same, one of the two renames will not work.  The
	error will be displayed telling you what happened and you may then
	correct the problem by renaming the file to something else.
