Sorry about fvirtual.doc (I won't fix it, but I'm sorry... Nyuk Nyuk).
Err, maybe I'll just make this message the doc.

	1> Put "fvirtual" as the first thing in your startup-sequence.
	
	2> Type "fvirtual", then "clearf", then "kickit" (or whatever)

	3> Reboot.

If you are using a dual-boot ROM, you must start from the built-in ROMs
(power off, both mouse buttons, click in the upper left corner).
Fvirtual and the dual-boot ROMs don't get along very well.
