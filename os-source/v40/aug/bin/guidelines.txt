Translation Guidelines
----------------------
These translated strings are what the user will see in your country when
booting an Amiga under AmigaDOS 2.1. Therefore, it is to your advantage that
the translation be perfect.

Proper names should never be translated. For example, "Workbench" must remain
"Workbench" regardless of the language.

Make sure the tense of verbs is correct.

Review the translated strings several times so that consistent wording and
style is used throughout.

Make sure you use accented characters whenever necessary.

Make sure the letter case is correct for your language. English tends to
capitalize many words that do not necessarily need to be capitalized in other
languages (menu items for example)

Keyboard shortcuts for menus should be localized.

Names of programs, directories, and files are not translated
