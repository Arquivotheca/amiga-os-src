				SPEAK:

Format:		Speak: [OPT/K]	

Template:

Purpose:	provide speach output

Specification:

	SPEAK: is an AmigaDOS handler.  It is not used directly.  It is
used like the other handlers (PAR:, SER:, and PRT:)  However, unlike
those, it must be mounted.  The mountlist entry for SPEAK: is as follows:

SPEAK:	   Handler = l:speak-handler
           Stacksize = 10000
           Priority = 5
           GlobVec  = 1
#

This must be added to the devs:MountList file.  Before SPEAK: may be used,
the mount statement must be executed.

The SPEAK: device uses the narrator.device and translator.library.  They
must be in DEVS: and LIBS: respectively.

SPEAK: may also be used from other programs, like a wordprocessor 
(as a filename during a save operation ) or a terminal program
(as a capture buffer filename) to get spoken output.

OPTIONS:

After the opt keyword, the following options may be used:
	P###    pitch (where ### is from 65-320)
	S###    speed (where ### is from 30-400)
	M       male
	F	female
