		Workbench V1.4 Alpha 15 Test Suite
		----------------------------------

	All of these programs must be run from the CLI and printf status
to the CLI window from which they were run.  They all also open a tiny
window in the top left corner of the Workbench screen to let you know
that they are running.  Select the CloseWindow gadget in the appropriate
window to remove the App Icon/MenuItem/Window.

1. AppIcon - test of the Application Icon interface.  Includes calls to
	     AddAppIcon and RemoveAppIcon.  When run an icon (named AppIcon)
	     will appear on the Workbench.  Double-clicking on it will
	     cause workbench to send a message which will be printed in
	     the CLI window.

2. AppMenuItem - test of the Application MenuItem interface.  Includes calls
		 to AddAppMenuItem and RemoveAppMenuItem.  When run two
		 menuitems (named appmenuitem1 and appmenuitem2) will be
		 added to the workbench Tools menu.  Selecting either one
		 of these menuitems will cause workbench to send a message
		 which will be printed in the CLI window.

3. AppWindow - test of the Application Window interface.  Includes calls to
	       AddAppWindow and RemoveAppWindow.  When run a window will
	       open in the top left corner of the workbench.  If icons are
	       dropped on this window workbench will send a message which
	       will be printed in the CLI window.
