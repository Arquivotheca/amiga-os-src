c/conclip  (new for V37 of O.S. 2.0)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FOR 2.0 (V37) : conclip --

        Under 2.0 it is now possible to drag-select text in Shell
        windows.  The selected text can be copied by pressing RIGHT
        AMIGA C, and pasted into other Shell windows by pressing
        RIGHTA AMIGA V.  It is also possible to extend a drag-selection
        by holding down one of the SHIFT keys while dragging.

        CONCLIP is a utility program which moves data between
        the console.device, the clipboard.device, and CON:

INSTALLATION OF conclip --

        CONCLIP should be placed in your startup-sequence; it detaches
        so there is no need to use the RUN command.  Once installed,
        text copied, and pastes are stored  where it can be read by
        other clipboard supporting applications. When you paste into
        shell windows, the contents of the clipboard is used.

        CONCLIP requires iffparse.library, and the clipboard.device.
        It wil open both the first time that you paste into a Shell
        window.  Because of this, floppy drive users may notice
        some delay as iffparse, and the clipboard.device are loaded
        from disk (assuming that no other program has already loaded
        both of these)
        
ARGUMENTS FOR conclip -
        
CONCLIP can take one of two arguments:

UNIT/N,OFF/S

        UNIT = 0-255 (specifies which clipboard.device unit number to use.
                      Default is unit 0.  The unit number can be changed
                      without turning CONCLIP off.  Simply issue the
                      command again with the new UNIT number.  Next time
                      you copy/paste, thats the unit number which will be
                      used).

        OFF = Turn CONCLIP off.
