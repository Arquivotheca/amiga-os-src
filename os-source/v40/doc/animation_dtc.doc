    NAME
	animation.datatype -- root data type for animations.

    FUNCTION
	The animation.datatype is the super-class for any animation related
	classes.

	This class is responsible for creating the controls, scaling,
	remapping and synchronization.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create a new animation object.

	OM_GET -- Obtain the value of an attribute.

	OM_SET -- Set the values of multiple attributes.

	OM_UPDATE -- Update the values of multiple attributes.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Dispose of a animation object.

	GM_LAYOUT -- Layout the object and notify the application of the
	    title and size.

	GM_HITTEST -- Determine if the object has been hit with the
	    mouse.

	GM_GOACTIVE -- Tell the object to go active.  On SELECTDOWN, the
	    animation will start playing.

	GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Handle input.  Currently input (other than
	    SELECTDOWN) doesn't affect the animation.

	GM_RENDER -- Cause the current frame to render.

	DTM_FRAMEBOX -- Obtain the display environment that the animation
	    requires.

	DTM_TRIGGER -- Cause an event to occur.  Currently the only
	    trigger event is STM_PLAY, which will cause the animation to start
	    playing.

	DTM_COPY -- Copy the current frame to the clipboard as an IFF ILBM.

	DTM_WRITE -- Write the current frame to a file as an IFF ILBM.

	DTM_PRINT -- Print the current frame.

	ADTM_LOADFRAME -- Load a frame of the animation.

	ADTM_UNLOADFRAME -- Deallocate any memory allocated by ADTM_LOADFRAME.

	ADTM_START -- Start the animation.  This MUST be passed to the
	    super-class AFTER the sub-class has started.

	ADTM_PAUSE -- Pause the animation.  This MUST be passed to the
	    super-class BEFORE the sub-class pauses.

	ADTM_STOP -- Stop the animation.  This MUST be passed to the
	    super-class BEFORE the sub-class stops.

	ADTM_LOCATE -- Used to locate a frame of the animation.

    TAGS
	DTA_ControlPanel (BOOL) -- Determine whether the control
	    panel is shown.  Defaults to TRUE.

	    Applicability is (I).

	DTA_Immediate (BOOL) -- Indicate whether the animation
	    should immediately begin playing.  Defaults to
	    FALSE.

	    Applicability is (I).

	ADTA_Remap (BOOL) -- Indicate whether the animation should be
	    remapped or not.

	    Applicability is (I).

	ADTA_ModeID (ULONG) -- Set and get the graphic mode id of the
	    picture.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	ADTA_Width (ULONG) -- Width of a frame in pixels.

	    Applicability is (IG).

	ADTA_Height (ULONG) -- Height of a frame in pixels.

	    Applicability is (IG).

	ADTA_Depth (ULONG) -- Depth of the frame.

	    Applicability is (IG).

	ADTA_Frames (ULONG) -- Number of frames in animation.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	ADTA_KeyFrame (struct BitMap *) -- Pointer to the key
	    frame.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	ADTA_FramesPerSecond (ULONG) -- Number of frames per
	    second to play.

	ADTA_NumColors (WORD) -- Number of colors used by the picture.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	ADTA_ColorRegisters (struct ColorRegister *) -- Color table.

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_CRegs (ULONG *) -- Color table to use with SetRGB32CM().

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_GRegs (ULONG *) -- Color table.

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_ColorTable (ULONG *) -- Shared pen table.

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_ColorTable2 (ULONG *) -- Shared pen table.

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_Allocated (ULONG) --  Number of shared colors allocated.

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_NumAlloc (WORD) -- Number of colors allocated by the picture.

	    Applicability is (G).

	ADTA_BitMapHeader (struct BitMapHeader *) -- Set and get the
	    base information for the animation.  BitMapHeader is defined in
	    <datatypes/pictureclass.h>

	    Applicability is (G).

	SDTA_Sample (BYTE *) -- Pointer to sample data.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	SDTA_SampleLength (ULONG) -- Length of sample data.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	SDTA_Period (ULONG) -- Period to play back sample at.

	    Applicability is (ISG).

	SDTA_Volume (ULONG) -- Volume to play back sample at.

	    Applicability is (ISG).
