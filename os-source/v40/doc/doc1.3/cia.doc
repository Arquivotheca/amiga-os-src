   NAME
       AbleICR -- enable/disable ICR interrupts

   SYNOPSIS
       oldMask = AbleICR(mask),  Resource
       D0                D0      A6

   FUNCTION
       This function provides a means of enabling and disabling
       6526 CIA interrupt control registers.
       In addition it returns the previous enable mask.

   INPUTS
       mask - a bit mask indicating which interrupts to be
           modified.  If bit 7 is clear the mask indicates
           interrupts to be disabled.  If bit 7 is set, the
           mask indicates interrupts to be enabled.
           Bit positions are identical to those in 6526 ICR.

   RESULTS
       oldMask - the previous enable mask before the requested
           changes.  To get the current mask without making
           changes, call the function with a null parameter.

   EXAMPLES
       Get the current mask:
           mask = AbleICR(0)
       Enable both timer interrupts:
           AbleICR(0x83)
       Disable serial port interrupt:
           AbleICR(0x08)

   EXCEPTIONS
       Enabling the mask for a pending interrupt will cause
       an immediate processor interrupt (that is if everything
       else is enabled).  You may want to clear the pending
       interrupts with SetICRx prior to enabling them.

cia.resource/AddICRVector                             cia.resource/AddICRVector

   NAME
	AddICRVector -- attach an interrupt handler to a CIA bit

   SYNOPSYS
	interrupt = AddICRVector(iCRBit, interrupt), resource
	D0	                 D0      A1          A6

   FUNCTION
	Assign interrupt processing code to a particular interrupt
	bit of the CIA ICR.  If the interrupt bit has already been
	assigned, this function will fail, and return a pointer
	to the owner interrupt.  If it succeeds, a null is returned.

	This function will also enable the CIA interrupt for the given
	ICR bit.

   INPUTS
	iCRBit - bit number to set (0..4)
	interrupt - pointer to interrupt structure

   RESULT
	interrupt - zero if successful, otherwise returns a pointer
		to the current owner interrupt structure.

   SEE ALSO
	RemICRVector


cia.resource/RemICRVector                             cia.resource/RemICRVector

   NAME
	RemICRVector -- detach an interrupt handler from a CIA bit

   SYNOPSYS
	RemICRVector(iCRBit, interrupt), resource
	             D0      A1          A6

   FUNCTION
	Disconnect interrupt processing code for a particular interrupt
	bit of the CIA ICR.

	This function will also disable the CIA interrupt for the given
	ICR bit.

   INPUTS
	iCRBit - bit number to set (0..4)
	interrupt - pointer to interrupt structure

   NAME
       SetICR -- cause, clear, and sample ICR interrupts

   SYNOPSIS
       oldMask = SetICR(mask), Resource
       D0               D0     A6

   FUNCTION
       This function provides a means of reseting, causing, and
       sampling 6526 CIA interrupt control registers.

   INPUTS
       mask - a bit mask indicating which interrupts to be
           effected.  If bit 7 is clear the mask indicates
           interrupts to be reset.  If bit 7 is set, the
           mask indicates interrupts to be caused.
           Bit positions are identical to those in 6526 ICR.

   RESULTS
       oldMask - the previous interrupt register status before
           making the requested changes.  To sample current
           status without making changes,  call the function
           with a null parameter.

   EXAMPLES
       Get the interrupt mask:
           mask = SetICR(0)
       Clear serial port interrupt:
           SetICR(0x08)

   EXCEPTIONS
       Setting an interrupt bit for an enabled interrupt will cause
	an immediate interrupt.
