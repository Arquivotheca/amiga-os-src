keyboard.device/CMD_CLEAR             keyboard.device/CMD_CLEAR

   NAME
	CMD_CLEAR - clear keyboard input buffer

   FUNCTION
	Remove from the input buffer any keys transitions waiting to
	satisfy read requests.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice
	io_Command	CMD_CLEAR
	io_Flags	IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible


keyboard.device/CMD_RESET                     keyboard.device/CMD_RESET

   NAME
	CMD_RESET - reset the keyboard

   FUNCTION
	CMD_RESET resets the keyboard device without destroying handles
	to the open device.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice
	io_Command	CMD_RESET
	io_Flags	IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible


keyboard.device/KBD_ADDRESETHANDER

   NAME
	KBD_ADDRESETHANDER - add a reset handler to the device

   FUNCTION
	Add a function to the list of functions called to clean up
	before a hard reset:
	    Handler(handlerData);
		    A1

	Note that the A500 does not support this.  CTRL-Amiga-Amiga
	on an A500 does an immediate hard processor reset.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set
	io_Device	preset by OpenDevice
	io_Unit		preset by OpenDevice
	io_Command	KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER
	io_Data		a pointer to an interrupt structure.
	    is_Data 	the handlerData pointer described above
	    is_Code	the Handler function address

   NOTES
	The interrupt structure is kept by the keyboard device until a
	KBD_REMRESETHANDLER command is satisfied for it.


keyboard.device/KBD_READEVENT             keyboard.device/KBD_READEVENT

   NAME
	KBD_READEVENT - return the next keyboard event.

   FUNCTION
	Read raw keyboard events from the keyboard and put them in the
	data area of the iORequest.  If there are no pending keyboard
	events, this command will not be satisfied, but if there are
	some events, but not as many as can fill IO_LENGTH, the
	request will be satisfied with those currently available.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice
	io_Command	KBD_READEVENT
	io_Flags	IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible
	io_Length	the size of the io_Data area in bytes: there
			are sizeof(inputEvent) bytes per input event.
	io_Data		a buffer area to fill with input events.  The
			fields of the input event are:
	    ie_NextEvent
			links the events returned
	    ie_Class
			is IECLASS_RAWKEY
	    ie_Code 
			contains the next key up/down reports
	    ie_Qualifier 
			only the shift and numeric pad bits are set
	    ie_SubClass, ie_X, ie_Y, ie_TimeStamp 
			are not used, and set to zero

   RESULTS
	This function sets the error field in the IORequest, and fills
	the IORequest with the next keyboard events (but not partial
	events).


keyboard.device/KBD_READMATRIX           keyboard.device/KBD_READMATRIX

   NAME
	KBD_READMATRIX - read the current keyboard key matrix

   FUNCTION
	This function reads the up/down state of every key in the
	key matrix.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice
	io_Command	KBD_READMATRIX
	io_Flags	IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible
	io_Length	the size of the io_Data area in bytes: this
			must be big enough to hold the key matrix.
	io_Data		a buffer area to fill with the key matrix:
			an array of bytes whose component bits reflect
			each keys state: the state of the key for
			keycode n is at bit (n MOD 8) in byte
			(n DIV 8) of this matrix.

   NOTE
	For V1.2/V1.3 Kickstart, io_Length must be set to exactly 13 bytes.

   RESULTS
	This function sets the error field in the IORequest, and sets
	matrix to the current key matrix.


keyboard.device/KBD_REMRESETHANDLER

   NAME
	KBD_REMRESETHANDLER - remove a reset handler from the device

   FUNCTION
	Remove a function previously added to the list of handler
	functions.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set
	io_Device	preset by OpenDevice
	io_Unit		preset by OpenDevice
	io_Command	KBD_REMRESETHANDLER
	io_Data		a pointer to the handler interrupt structure.


keyboard.device/KBD_RESETHANDLERDONE

   NAME
	KBD_RESETHANDLERDONE - indicate that reset can occur

   FUNCTION
	Indicate that reset cleanup associated with the handler has
	completed.

   IO REQUEST
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set
	io_Device	preset by OpenDevice
	io_Unit		preset by OpenDevice
	io_Command	KBD_RESETHANDLERDONE
	io_Data		a pointer to the handler interrupt structure.
