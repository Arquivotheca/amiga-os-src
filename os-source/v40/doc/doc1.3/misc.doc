    NAME
	MR_ALLOCMISCRESOURCE - allocate one of the misc resources

    SYNOPSIS
       CurrentUser = MR_ALLOCMISCRESOURCE( unitNum, name ), misc.resource
       D0	                           D0       A1      A6

	STRPTR CurrentUser;
	LONG unitNum;
	STRPTR name;

    FUNCTION
	This routine allocates one of the miscellaneous resources.
	If the resource is currently allocated, an error is returned.
	If you do get it, your name is associated with the resource
	(so a user can see who has it allocated).

	This routine may not be called from an interrupt routine

    DESCRIPTION
	There are certain parts of the hardware that a multitasking-
	friendly program may need to take over.  The serial port
	is a good example.  By grabbing the misc.resource for the
	serial port, the caller would "own" the hardware registers
	associated with that function.  Nobody else, including the
	system serial driver is allowed to interfere.

	The misc.resource must be accessed using assembly language.  The set
	of currently defined units and the function offsets from the resource 
	base are listed in the resources/misc.i include file.

    INPUTS
	unitNum - the number of the resource you want to allocate
		  (eg.  MR_SERIALBITS).
	name - a mnenonic name that will help the user figure out
		what piece of software is hogging a resource.
		(havoc breaks out if a name of null is passed in...)

    RESULTS
	CurrentUser - if the resource is busy, then the name of
		the current user is returned.  If the resource is
		free, then null is returned.

    NAME
	MR_FREEMISCRESOURCE - make a resource available for reallocation

    SYNOPSIS
        MR_FREEMISCRESOURCE( unitNum ), misc.resource
                             D0         A6
	LONG unitNum;

    FUNCTION
	This routine frees one of the resources allocated
	by MR_ALLOCMISCRESOURCE.  The resource is made available
	for reuse.

	This routine may not be called from an interrupt routine.

    INPUTS
	unitNum - the number of the miscellaneous resource to be freed.

    RESULTS
	Frees the appropriate resource.
