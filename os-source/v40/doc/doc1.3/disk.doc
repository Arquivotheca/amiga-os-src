disk.resource/AllocUnit                     disk.resource/AllocUnit

   NAME
       AllocUnit - allocate a unit of the disk

   SYNOPSIS
       Success = AllocUnit( unitNum ), DRResource
	D0     	             D0         A6

   FUNCTION
	This routine allocates one of the units of the disk.  It should
	be called before trying to use the disk (via GetUnit).

   INPUTS
	unitNum -- a legal unit number (zero through three)

   RESULTS
	Success -- nonzero if successful.  zero on failure.

disk.resource/FreeUnit                       disk.resource/FreeUnit

   NAME
       FreeUnit - deallocate the disk

   SYNOPSIS
       FreeUnit( unitNum ), DRResource
		  D0         A6

   FUNCTION
	This routine deallocates one of the units of the disk.  It should
	be called when done with the disk.  Do not call it if you did
	no successfully allocate the disk (there is no protection -- you
	will probably crash the disk system).

   INPUTS
	unitNum -- a legal unit number (zero through three)

disk.resource/GetUnit                         disk.resource/GetUnit

   NAME
       GetUnit - allocate the disk for a driver

   SYNOPSIS
       lastDriver = GetUnit( unitPointer ), DRResource
       D0		      A1             A6

   FUNCTION
	This routine allocates the disk to a driver.  It is either
	immediately available, or the request is saved until the disk
	is available.  When it is available, your unitPointer is
	sent back to you (via ReplyMsg).  You may then reattempt the
	GetUnit.
	
	Allocating the disk allows you to use the disk's resources.
	Remember however that there are four units to the disk; you are
	only one of them.  Please be polite to the other units (by never
	selecting them, and by not leaving interrupts enabled, etc.).

	When you are done, please leave the disk in the following state:
	    dmacon dma bit ON
	    dsklen dma bit OFF (write a #DSKDMAOFF to dsklen)
	    adkcon disk bits -- any way you want
	    entena:disk sync and disk block interrupts -- Both DISABLED
	    CIA resource index interrupt -- DISABLED
	    8520 outputs -- doesn't matter, because all bits will be
		set to inactive by the resource.
	    8520 data direction regs -- restore to original state.

   INPUTS
	unitPtr - a pointer you your disk resource unit structure.
		Note that the message filed of the structure MUST
		be a valid message, ready to be replied to.

   RESULTS
	lastDriver - if the disk is not busy, then the last unit
		to use the disk is returned.  This may be used to
		see if a driver needs to reset device registers.
		(If you were the last user, then no one has changed
		any of the registers.  If someone else has used it,
		then any allowable changes may have been made).  If the
		disk is busy, then a null is returned.

disk.resource/GetUnitID                     disk.resource/GetUnitID

   NAME
       GetUnitID - find out what type of disk is out there

   SYNOPSIS
       idtype = GetUnitID( unitNum ), DRResource
	D0	            D0         A6

   FUNCTION

   INPUTS

   RESULTS
	idtype -- the type of the disk drive.  Standard types are
		defined in the resource include file.

disk.resource/GiveUnit                       disk.resource/GiveUnit

   NAME
       GiveUnit - Free the disk back up

   SYNOPSIS
       GiveUnit(), DRResource
           	    A6

   FUNCTION
	This routine frees the disk after a driver is done with it.
	If others are waiting, it will notify them.
