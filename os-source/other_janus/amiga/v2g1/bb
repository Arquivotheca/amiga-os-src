                   JANUS BRIDGEBOARD Known BUG Summary
                      V2.0 Alpha 1 Software release


Hardware
--------
1). PC Lock instruction causes dual port memory to lock up permanently.

2). 2090 DMA out of dual port reads garbage.

3). 2088 will not format a 3.5" drive installed as b:
    Sometimes format of a: fails.

Software
--------
JLINK      -   Has always been "flakey" should be modified to use a second
      FAT, Should fully expand when created, needs to share the
      pcdisk buffer in an autoboot/aread/awrite compatible fashion.

JDISK      -   Must be modified to work with FFS and use the normal format
      command.

MOUSE      -   Must be written on PC and Amiga sides.

PCWINDOW   -    Keyboard confusion problem (ie PC thinks its in shift lock)
      Cursor keys should always be cursor keys.
      Credits option must be removed.

AUTOBOOT   -   User interface and docs.

SERVICES   -    Testing of all functions.

C BINDINGS -   Finish PC C lanquage bindings.

?      -   PC Hardware problems.


       Sugestions for Handling above problems
       --------------------------------------

1). Torsen and bill should get together and work on finishing services.
    AutoBoot was working before services and works under services with slight
    problems. I believe these problems were introduced with code related
    to services and that finishing and debuging services will fix the problem.
    If we find that part of the problem is related to R.J.'s
    code we will need him also. 
    R.J. is in CA working on the finishing touches to the Amiga side of 
    services. His code has been tested and seems solid. The PC side of
    services is lagging behind the Amiga side mostly because R.J. designs
    implements and tests new funtions before torsten knows he has to support
    them. 

2). The other problems can be worked on concurently by the appropriate
    people.


      Proposed schedule for Beta 1 Release
      ------------------------------------

June 6-24
---------
   Bill and Torsten work in germany pounding out bugs and testing
   services. (Hopefully) fixing AutoBoot in the process.

   Concurently
   -----------
      Dieter   -   JLINK
      Steve B   -   Jdisk.device
      R.J.   -   PCWindow, Mouse support, Services Docs.
      ?   -   Hardware
      ?   -   PC Mouse support

In Between
----------
   All parties make final tweaks and adjustments to prepare for
   July integration.

July 2-3 weeks
--------------
   Bill, R.J., and torsten get together in California for finishing
   touches, integration, and documentation.

August 1st
----------
   V2.0 Beta 1 release of janus software to developer community.

In Between
----------
   Developer Testing.
   QA

September 1st
-------------
   Evaluation to determine if Gamma 1 or public release is in order.



      History of progress since Jan 1988
      ----------------------------------

1st Trip
--------
R.J. Mical   -   Designed services.
         Investigated mouse support.

Bill Koester   -   Fixed BUGS in janus.library
         Rewrote Aread/Awrite to perform character
         conversion. Increased speed 5x. Documentation.
         Rewrote pcdisk in preparation for services and
         fixed BUGS.
         Got 2 cents into the design of services.

2nd Trip
--------
Bill Koester   -   Wrote AutoBoot and tested succesfully.
         Began work on testing services.

Torsten      -   Began work on implementing services.

3rd Trip
--------
R.J. Mical   
Torsten      -   Got services working with channel numbers

Bill Koester   -   Got AutoBoot working with services.
         Wrote the first test/example program for services.
         Began work on C Language bindings.
         Found and corrected MANY bugs in services.

Before DEVCON
-------------
R.J. Mical
Torsten      -   Got services working without channel numbers.
         Broke AutoBoot.

Bill Koester   -   Attempted to fix AutoBoot without success.
         Coordinated duplication and distribution of
         V2.0 Aplha 1 software release at DEVCON.
