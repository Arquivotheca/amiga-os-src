     RE:    Janus V2.0 Gamma 1

          The enclosed Gamma 1 disks may not be licensed or generally
     distributed.  You may, however, make the Gamma 1 disks available
     to developers registered in your Amiga developer programs, for
     Gamma-testing purposes. If you duplicate the disks for developer
     distribution, all disk labels must include the same copyrights
     and warnings against distribution as the labels on the enclosed
     Gamma disks. In addition, a cover letter similar to the one enclosed
     must be supplied, which tells all Gamma-testers that they must read
     the "About This Disk" file on the PCInstall disk.
