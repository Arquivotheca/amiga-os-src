                         PCHard - PC Hard Reset program
                         ------------------------------


PCHard will (most of the time) reset the PC to a power up condition. This
program can be used to reset the PC when it becomes severely "locked up" ie
when cntrl-alt-del will not work. This program may NOT always work. If the PC
resets but still fails to work properly it may be necessary to reboot the
Amiga!

Usage:
   From CLI

      PCHard

   From Workbench

      Double click on the PCHard icon in the SYS:PC drawer.
