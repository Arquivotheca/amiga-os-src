PCWINDOW CURSOR KEYS DON'T ALWAYS WORK

	pcwindow emulates an XT keyboard, so the seperate cursor keys
	are handled like this (don't read this if you ate recently):

	if the key is one of the cursor cluster,
		if we think NUMLOCK is on,
			send NUMLOCK keycode to PC
		send cursor keycode to PC
		if we think NUMLOCK is on,
			send NUMLOCK keycode to PC

	so, if pcwindow's idea of NUMLOCK doesn't match the pc's (BIOS
	and/or application program) idea of NUMLOCK, they won't work.
	also, some applications may be confused by the rapid-fire
	sequence of keycodes.

	to fix this, i'll likely just send AT keyboard keycodes for the
	cursor keys.  however, the 2088 and sidecar BIOSes may not be
	able to handle such things.  maybe do it the old way for 2088
	and sidecar, and new way for 2286 and 2386.

ALT-SPACE

	again, pcwindow does XT keycodes only.  the XT has only one ALT
	key.  see above for fix.

ENTER KEY ON KEYPAD

	looked around for 1/2 hour, couldn't find a clue.

SYSTEM REQUEST KEY

	XT kb, remember?
