=== THIS DIRECTORY ===========================================================
This directory contains a version of Zaphod that seems to work OK.
There are still some things I would like to include, bug at least there
are no outstanding bugs.

For information about the things I would do next, see the issues.doc file.

Now, I'm going home to my sweetie.  =RJ Mical=
