New REPORT Bug Report Generating Program
========================================

The bug, compatibility, and enhancement request forms have been
replaced by the Amiga REPORT program (in the Kickfile/Tools directory).

Please do not use the old report forms.  We are now using a different format
to provide more compact and  consistent input to engineering's database.

By using the REPORT program, you will be prompted for appropriate
information, and it will be formatted in a consistent manner for
proper sorting by various database tools.


If you can't use the REPORT program, and need to use blank report forms
instead, then please generate your own new-format report forms by using
REPORT but not entering any summary, subsystem, product name, etc.
If you do this, you should generate 4 different report forms by selecting
different options of REPORT:
	1. system bug report
	2. compatibility bug (select a,b,or c classification)
	3. compatibility ok  (select w classification)
	4. enhancement request


Here are a summary of the usage and files created by REPORT, and report
submission instructions.

This same information is printed by the "help" command line option of REPORT.
