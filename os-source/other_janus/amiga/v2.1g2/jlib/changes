Changes from V2.0 to V2.01

Who            When        What
------------   ---------   ----
Bill Koester   20-Apr-89   Fixed AddService to allow addign a service
                           without allocating data memory.

Bill Koester   26-apr-89   Fixed ExpungeService. Was calling
                           FreeServiceMem() with A0,D0. Should have been
                           A0,A1 *poof*

Bill Koester   27-apr-89   Patched init.asm to set the jmh_Max field for
                           buffer memory to $4000 less on an AT

Bill Koester   27-apr-89   Fixed return value from ReBoot8088 in init.asm
                           to return the size in bytes of code loaded
                           rather than the offset from the begining of the
                           segment. On an at where the seg begins at d400
                           the returned value was to large by $4000

Bill Koester   27-apr-89   Fixed the init of JanusMemBase for buffer mem
                           to be at offset $4000 instead of offset $000

Bill Koester   01-may-89   Fixed memclear in service task to do 1 less
                           byte (was not set up for dbra)
