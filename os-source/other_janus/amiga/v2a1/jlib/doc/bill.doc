AddService() and GetService() now have as a first argument a pointer to a 
pointer to a ServiceData structure, which is set to point to either a 
ServiceData structure or NULL if the call failed for any reason.  These 
routines now return a result code, the definitions of which can be found 
at the end of the services.h file.  I don't know how closely these 
definitions jive with the ones you've declared on the PC side, but I'm sure 
that with a little work we can make them uniform.  See the autodocs.  

I would like to be granted a second ApplicationID number.  As I created the 
buggers, I don't imagine there should be too much trouble with letting me 
have two numbers.  I would like to own both numbers 101 and 123.  Suffice it 
to say that I find 123 to be my magic number.  Is this OK?
