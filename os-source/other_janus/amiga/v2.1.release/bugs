JANUS 2.1 BUG STATUS - PART WAY THROUGH 2.1G4

The bugs listed below are grouped into several categories.  If your
favorite bug isn't listed, then it's not on my "fix it for 2.1" list.
Note that most PCWindow problems need the new (nonexistant) PCWindow.

This list corresponds to the PA Bridgeboard bug meeting of August 20.

Only *Janus* bugs are listed here - for BIOS or hardware stuff,
contact Weipo or John.

FIXED IN JANUS 2.1G4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  PC Technician 386 will not boot with the virtual/fake drive enabled.

Since many of our users are not familiar with text editors, modify C:MakeAB 
to automatically update SYS:PC/System/aboot.ctrl.  In addition, a C:RemoveAB 
or C:DeleteAB command would remove the need for the user to manually delete 
the AutoBoot drive file and edit the SYS:PC/System/aboot.ctrl file.
(NOTE: DIDN'T DO "DELETEAB" - FIXED MAKEAB TO CREATE ABOOT.CTRL)

The latest incarnation of PC Color has a default color 0 that is somewhat 
red.  Color 0 defaults to 0x02 (Red), 0x00 (Green), 0x00 (Blue).  
It should be:  0x00 (Red), 0x00 (Green), 0x00 (Blue) 

If the user selects the "Cancel" gadget in the Janus Install program, the 
requester:  "Installation error:  User Abort from Install List Edit screen"
is displayed.  This is unnecessary; the user knows that he hit "Cancel".

The requester title bar says:  "File Blocks Selected To Install [ 432]".  This 
probably applies to all error requesters, although none of the others have 
been seen.  This title bar should be changed to something like "PC Install".

During the actual disk access involved in creating an autoboot partition, 
<Ctrl>-<C> cannot be used to abort MakeAB.

The BridgeBoard documentation indicates that C:MakeAB will fail with a
"Volume <volume> is full" requester, followed by a disk full error, if the 
volume does not have sufficent free space for the autoboot partition.
C:MakeAB should be modified to check the free space on the volume and fail 
with an error message indicating that there is insufficent free space for 
the autoboot partition, before starting the process.

Change the name of the disk to something without PC in the name.
(PC INSTALL -> AMIGA JANUS, JANUS UTILITIES -> PC JANUS)

Recommend renaming the PCHard program to PCReset, or something similar.
PCHard implies, PC hard disk, or something related.
(PCHARD -> PCRESET)

Change AMOUSE to refer to first and second ports instead of right and left, 
so that it won't be A2000 specific.

LPT1 is incompatible with CMD (or any other parallel.device re-director).
(SEE LPT1 (OLD) VS. LPT1X (NEW) IN 2.1G4 RELEASE NOTES)

Flipper does not display a template when the "?" argument is given.
In fact, it appears to do absolutely nothing -- no error messages, no
window, no nothing.  This is in violation of the Amiga user interface 
guidelines.  As with MakeAB, Flipper should use ReadArgs under >=V36, 
or emulate the behavior of ReadArgs under <V36.

If Flipper is run with an invalid number of arguments (or no arguments), it 
outputs the message:  "Argument count".  The correct error message form is:  
<program name>: <error>.  In this case, <program name> is "Flipper".  The 
<error> should be a standard AmigaDOS error message.  So, if Flipper is run 
with an invalid number of arguments (or no arguments), it should output the 
message:  "Flipper: Required argument missing" (DOS error message 116) or
"Flipper: Wrong number of arguments" (DOS error message 118).

The "JLink" section of the BridgeBoard/Janus documentation indicates that if 
the user specifies the /C option and the Amiga JLink file already exists, the 
user will be prompted with the option of replacing the file or terminating 
the operation.  In actuality, the operation is terminated without prompting.

MakeAB does not supply a template and prompt for parameters if the "?" 
parameter is given.  This is in violation of the Amiga user interface 
guidelines.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEND TO FIX FOR FINAL 2.1 RELEASE (IN ORDER OF DECREASING LIKELIHOOD
OF GETTING FIXED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The numeric keypad <Enter> key maps to the PC side numeric keypad <9> key.  
This was discovered using the QAPlus PC diagnostic software's keyboard test.  
The keymap specified was XT, which most closely matches the Amiga keyboard.
An attempt was made to fix this bug, but now the <Enter> does nothing.

9)  A "Pause/Break" key would be very useful for scrolling large text and
    aborting out of an unwanted file execution. 

11) During Paintbrush IV setup the Numlock key functioned correctly only with 
    the 2,4,5,6,8 keys.  The dedicated cursor keys were somehow remapped as 
    numeric keys.  On exit, the state of the numeric keypad is altered.

12) Cursor keys will not function with F19 and DBase IV. 

13) Cursor keys lock at the third setup option on Software Carousel.

14) The ALT-SPACE key combination in Software Carousel which normally 
    produces a menu, does not function.

1)  A "System Request" key must be added to the Amiga keyboard 
    layout to allow virtual terminal use in Interactive Unix.   

The Janus install scroll gadgets do not auto-repeat.  Since each action moves
one line, it takes a long time to move through a hard disk partition.

Blinking text in PCWindow doesn't work

The "Use" option of PCPrefs appears to be irreversible.
PCPrefs doesn't support multiple preset files.
PCPrefs doesn't have the standard Prefs editor menus.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAY BE FIXED (COULD NOT REPRODUCE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install (BridgeInstall on 2.1g2 of the PC Install Disk) crashes with enforcer 
hits while clicking on a vertical scroll gadget during the "Delete files" mode.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE EXPLAIN/DEMONSTRATE (WORKS FOR ME...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Release 2.0 (or better) of the Amiga System Software, ARead should 
support 2.0-style wildcards (using the dos.library ParsePattern, ExAll, 
MatchFirst, MatchNext, and/or MatchPattern functions).
