AMouse consists of four files :
	(a)	AMouse		- the mouse controller on the Amiga.
				  This should be in your PC Drawer.
	(b)	AMOUSE.COM	- the mouse driver for the PC.
				  This should be in a directory which is on
				  your load path for the PC. See description
				  of PATH command in your MS-DOS Manual.
	(c)	AMOUSE.DRV	- the MS-Windows mouse driver.
				  This is only needed while doing Windows
				  Setup. For Windows version 1 it must
				  be on the Diskette which contains the other
				  xxMOUSE.DRV files (copy it onto a backup).
				  For Windows version 2 you can put it where
				  you like and tell Setup where to find it.
	(d)	AMOUSEX.DRV	- the MS-Windows mouse driver for SideCar.
				  See comments for AMOUSE.DRV.

Using AMouse.

    On the Amiga:

	AMouse is in the PC Drawer. It can be started by double-clicking
the AMouse icon or by using the CLI Run command. The CLI command is
"run >nil: AMouse". This can be input in a CLI Window or added to your
StartUp-Sequence file. It must come after the BindDrivers call which
starts up your BridgeBoard.

	When started, AMouse uses the right mouse (joystick) port for the
PC Mouse. If you want to use two mice just stick the second into the right
port and you're ready to go. If, like most people, you want to use just the
one mouse then you can use the combination LEFT AMIGA Key + P
to switch the ports. When you've done that once the PC mouse is on the left 
and Intuition on the right port. Do it again and Intuition's mouse is back 
where it used to be. While your doing this AMouse will be telling (trying to
tell) you which port the PC mouse is on by writing a comment into the title
bar of all windows whose title start " PC ".






    On the PC:

	AMouse can be invoked by typing "AMouse<return>" at the MS-DOS command
level or by adding it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. AMouse on the PC will
not initialise until AMouse on the Amiga is running. If the Amiga AMouse is
not running the PC Amouse will output a message to this effect and wait until
you start AMouse on the Amiga or you press a key (while the PC Window is
active).

	Parameters:
		-cText	Certain programmes (e.g. CodeView) look for 
			specific totally meaningless text strings in the
			driver code. You can use the -c parameter to supply
			such a string, should you wish to do so.
			An example which I have found useful is :-

AMOUSE -c"*** This is Copyright 1983 Microsoft ***"

		-i	AMouse uses the timer interrupt(8). Some programmes
			treat this as their own. Should you come up against
			one the -i parameter causes AMouse to use 'user' timer
			interrupt (1c). The only case I've come across so far
			is WordPerfect when used with the Microsoft Mouse Menus
			Programme. Don't use -i unless you have to. The mouse
			seems to run slower when using it.

		-tn	Outputs video information to the screen when called.
			Also turns on tracing to the printer if n is not 0.
			The trace is not printable !.

	
		-x	This is needed by SideCar users.
			(for Windows equivalent is to use driver AMOUSEX.DRV)


	Separate multiple parameters with a space character. e.g.

AMOUSE -c"Have a nice day!" -i

	If you call AMouse when it is already loaded it passes the supplied
parameters to the already loaded version. 

***** take care : it also passes the omission of parameters (i.e. if you
		  leave a parameter out it resets to the default).

	MS-Windows or EXCEL:
		AMOUSE.DRV is the Windows mouse driver. Put it where Setup
	can find it an do the normal installation. When you come to pointing
	devices it should appear in the list. For Windows version 2 change the
	mouse selection from the default (Microsoft) and select "Other".
	When Setup asks for the Mouse driver disk type in the full path name
	of the directory which contains the file AMOUSE.DRV (You may need
	to delete the "A:" supplied as default by Setup). Setup will recognise
	that AMOUSE.DRV is a Mouse driver and allow you to select it.

		The "x" driver is for SideCar users only.

		You do not need to call AMouse.com to use Windows. However
	if you want to run a Standard Application (.e. MS-DOS programme)
	from Windows and to use the Mouse from this programme you must
	call AMouse before the programme is invoked.

	GEM:
		the easiest (to describe) way to install GEM is to copy 
	AMOUSE.COM to a diskette and call it (AMOUSE.COM)  MOUSE.COM. When
	installing GEM use this disk when asked for the Microsoft Mouse disk. 

	(e.g. COPY C:\AMIGA\AMOUSE.COM A:MOUSE.COM )

	The other way is to :-
		(a).	make a dummy MOUSE.COM on a disk
				(e.g. ECHO DUMMY >A:MOUSE.COM)
		(b).	install GEM to use the Microsoft Bus Mouse and
			when asked for the MOUSE.COM disk insert the one
			with the MOUSE.COM created in step (a).
		(c).	when GEM is installed, edit the GEM.BAT file to
			replace the call of MOUSE with a call of AMouse.
		(d).	delete the dummy MOUSE.COM from GEMBOOT.

Using the AMouse trace.


	AMouse traces mouse and EGA library calls to LPT1. The trace is not
printable. Using the LPT1Splr utility is possible to redirect the trace to
a file. The contents of this file may then be interpreted using the Dump
utility.
