PCWindow 2.0 Beta 1 Changes
-Robert J. Mical




This file documents the external (and some of the internal) changes to 
PCWindow between the 1.0 and 2.0 beta 1 releases.  Also, known bugs 
and possible future enhancements are listed.  



=== External Changes ==========================================================

- Changed "Info" menu to "Help"
- HELP key is now supported, which brings up the last-viewed help page
- Changed text at bottom of help page gadget to "Next Help Topic" 
- Amiga cursor keys always act as if the PC had NUM LOCK cleared and the 
  numeric keypads cursor keys were being used.  This is true regardless 
  of the current NUM LOCK state
- NUM LOCK now is set when the Amiga first boots.  Also, the state of NUM LOCK 
  is remembered between invocations of PCWindow
- See AMouse program documentation for externally switching Amiga mouse 
  input to the PC
- Got rid of "Info" menu subitems "Credits"
- Created a new menu item "About"
- User now can adjust the time delay between transmission of 
  keystroke events to the PC.  This is used to help the PC avoid 
  buffer overflow, which in the past has caused PCWindow 
  and the PC to lose track of each other when the user hit 
  CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK.  Currently the user can adjust this 
  time using a new, perhaps temporary, menu option named 
  "Adjust Key Timing."  The default is 5000 microseconds between 
  keystroke transmissions, which limits the transmission rate to 
  200 events per second, which is equivalent to typing 100 characters 
  per second.  This shouldn't be a problem for most typists
- PCWindow is much more agreeable now when pieces of the system 
  aren't available or when out-of-memory conditions are reached.  
  The "System failure, unable to continue" requester will be 
  seen far less often now
- Because of the keystroke transmission throttle, it's now 
  easier to paste text from the Amiga into the PC without overflowing 
  the buffer.  
- There's a new SidecarKeys.Table file, which file belongs in the 
  sys:sidecar directory.



=== Known Bugs ================================================================

- Typing CONTROL-ALT-DEL into the PCWindow display causes the PC to reboot, 
  as expected, but also has the drawback of causing the Console Device to 
  lose its mind every second time you type CONTROL-ALT-DEL.  
  Weird characters start appearing when you type into a Console Device 
  window.  The most common Console Device window is the CLI window.  
  You can fix the problem easily by selecting a Console Device window 
  and type CONTROL-ALT.  



=== Possible Future Enhancements ==============================================

- Access to more detailed online help
- PCWindow preferences 
- Display NUM LOCK and SCROLL LOCK somehow
- Special border mode with borders and gadgets invisible but still accessible
- Save and restore *all* user settings and preferences 
- Making capability to switch mouse ownership from Amiga to PC 
  internal to the PCWindow program
- Improved text display performance
