Janus.Library 2.0 Beta 1 Changes
-Robert J. Mical




This file documents the external (and some of the internal) changes to 
janus.library between the alpha 1 and beta 1 releases.  Also, known bugs 
and possible future enhancements are listed.  



=== External Changes ==========================================================

- Fixed sundry bugs
- Improved the documentation
- Implemented some of the AddService() and GetService() flags
- Many janus structures have changed.  Any structure released prior to 
  the Alpha 1 release which changed for the Beta 1 release was changed only 
  by adding fields to the end of the structure; fields within the structure 
  are still in the normal positions, so old software should still work (poof).  
  Structures new with the Alpha 1 release have changed in many ways.  
  All code will need to be recompiled.  



=== Known bugs ================================================================

- No known bugs, though a key feature, Autoloading, is still unimplemented.  
  Shades of mutual-excluding gadgets!



=== Possible Future Enhancements ==============================================

- Amiga and PC Autoload, where an application of either side can cause a 
  program on the other side to be automatically loaded and executed.  
  Not very difficult on the Amiga side, quite a job on the PC side!
- Documentation needs to be finished, with lots of examples and 
  illustrations.  
- Publish both the Amiga and the PC versions of the Partyline program 
  as a detailed example of how to program using janus.library services.
