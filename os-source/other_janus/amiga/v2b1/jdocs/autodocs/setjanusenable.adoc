NAME
    SetJanusEnable  --  Enable or disable a Janus interrupt


SYNOPSIS
    OldEnable = SetJanusEnable(JanusInterruptNumber, Enable);
    D0                         D0                    D1

        ULONG   OldEnable;
        ULONG   JanusInterruptNumber;
        ULONG   Enable;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine enables or disables a particular Janus interrupt.

    Each Janus interrupt may be individually enable or disabled (this is
    in addition to the control of setting the interrupt handler
    to NULL).  If the interrupt is disabled then requests that are
    received will not generate interrupts.  These requests may be
    detected via SetJanusRequest.

    If Enable is 0 then the interrupt is disabled.  If it is
    1 then the interrupt is enabled.  All other values are reserved.

    "This routine will initiate interrupt processing if a newly-enabled
    interrupt has a pending request."  Unfortunately, this, like Intuition
    mutually-excluding gadgets, does not currently happen.

    This is a very low-level Janus routine.  You sure you want to be
    down here?  You are probably better served by dealing with one of
    the higher-up routines such as SetupJanusSig() or Add/GetService().


INPUTS
    JanusInterruptNumber = the number of the Janus interrupt that you
        want to modify.  These are defined in services.[hi]
    Enable = 1 if you want to enable the interrupt, 0 if you want to
        disable the interrupt.  All other values are reserved


RESULTS
    OldEnable = 1 if the interrupt was enabled at the time of the call,
        0 if the interrupt was disabled
