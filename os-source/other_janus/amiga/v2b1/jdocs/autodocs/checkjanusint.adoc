NAME
    CheckJanusInt  --  Check whether the PC has noticed a Janus interrupt


SYNOPSIS
    Status = CheckJanusInt(JanusInterruptNumber);
    D0                     D0
        ULONG   Status;
        ULONG   JanusInterruptNumber;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This call returns the status byte from the interrupt area
    associated with JanusInterruptNumber.  It can be used to tell
    if the PC has noticed a pending interrupt yet.  A value of
    JNOINT (0xFF) means no interrupt is pending (which probably
    means that the PC has already processed it).  JSENDINT (0x7F)
    means that the interrupt is pending.  Anything else should
    be treated with suspicion.

    This is a very low-level Janus routine.  You are probably better
    served by dealing with one of the higher-up routines such as
    SetupJanusSig() or, better yet, Add/GetService().


INPUTS
    JanusInterruptNumber = the number of the Janus interrupt that you
        want to check.  These are defined in services.[hi]


RESULTS
    Status = the status byte from the interrupt area of JanusInterruptNumber
