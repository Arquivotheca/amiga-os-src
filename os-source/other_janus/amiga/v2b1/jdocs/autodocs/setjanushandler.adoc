NAME
    SetJanusHandler  --  Set up an interrupt handler for a Janus interrupt


SYNOPSIS
    OldHandler = SetJanusHandler(JanusInterruptNumber, InterruptHandler);
    D0                           D0                    A1

        APTR    OldHandler;
        ULONG   JanusInterruptNumber;
        APTR    InterruptHandler;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine sets up an interrupt handler for a particular Janus
    interrupt.  The address of the old interrupt routine is returned.
    A NULL means that there was no previous handler for this interrupt.
    If you provide an InterruptHandler argument of NULL then interrupts
    will not be processed for that JanusInterruptNumber.

    This is a very low-level Janus routine.  Scary things lurk in the
    shadows down here.  You are probably better served by dealing with one
    of the higher-up routines such as SetupJanusSig() or Add/GetService().


INPUTS
    JanusInterruptNumber = the number of the Janus interrupt that you
        want to service.  These are defined in services.[hi]
    InterruptHandler = the address of your interrupt code


RESULTS
    OldHandler = the address of the handler that previously managed
        this interrupt
