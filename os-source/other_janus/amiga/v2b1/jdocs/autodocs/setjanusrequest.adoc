NAME
    SetJanusRequest  --  Set or clear interrupt request for a Janus interrupt


SYNOPSIS
    OldRequest = SetJanusRequest(JanusInterruptNumber, Request);
    D0                           D0                    D1

        ULONG   OldRequest;
        ULONG   JanusInterruptNumber;
        ULONG   Request;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine sets or clears an interrupt request for a Janus
    interrupt.  If the Request argument is zero then the request is
    cleared.  If the Request argument is one then the request is set.
    In either case the old value of the request state is returned.

    Setting a request one day will generate an interrupt if the request is
    "enabled".  This does not currently happen.  Tant pis.

    This is a very low-level Janus routine.  You sure you want to be
    down here?  You are probably better served by dealing with one of
    the higher-up routines such as SetupJanusSig() or Add/GetService().


INPUTS
    JanusInterruptNumber = the number of the Janus interrupt that you
        want to service.  These are defined in services.[hi]
    Request = 1 if you want to set an interrupt request, 0 if you want
        to clear any interrupt request.  All other values are reserved


RESULTS
    OldRequest = 1 if an interrupt request was pending, 0 if
        no interrupt request was pending
