NAME
    AttachJRemember  --  Attach the list of one Janus memory key to another

SYNOPSIS
    VOID AttachJRemember(ToKey, FromKey);
                         A0     A1
        struct  JanusRemember **ToKey;
        struct  JanusRemember **FromKey;
    From assembly, expects JanusBase in A6


FUNCTION
    This routine accepts two Janus RememberKeys created by calls to
    AllocJRemember() and attaches the contents of the FromKey to
    the ToKey.  In the process, FromKey is set equal to NULL.
    The result is that ToKey is comprised of a list of all the
    memory allocations, while FromKey points, correctly, to no list.

    If either key points to NULL, as the result, for instance, of a
    failed call to AllocJRemember(), no problem.  This routine detects
    those cases and handles them appropriately.

    A common use for this type of routine (also outlined below under EXAMPLE):
        - make a series of local memory allocations using AllocJRemember()
        - if any allocations fail, abandon ship by calling FreeJRemember()
          to free up the local list
        - if all allocations succeed use AttachJRemember() to add the list
          to a global list of allocations, which is freed in the end
          using FreeJRemember() when your program is terminating


EXAMPLE
    struct JanusRemember *GlobalJKey = NULL;

        exampleAllocJ(&GlobalJKey);
        exampleAllocJ(&GlobalJKey);
        exampleAllocJ(&GlobalJKey);
        FreeJRemember(&GlobalJKey, TRUE);

    exampleAllocJ(globalkey)
    struct JanusRemember **globalkey;
    {
        BOOL success;
        struct JanusRemember *localkey;

        success = FALSE;
        localkey = NULL;

        if (AllocJRemember(&localkey, 10000, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_WORDACCESS))
          if (AllocJRemember(&localkey, 100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_WORDACCESS))
            if (AllocJRemember(&localkey, 1, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_WORDACCESS))
              success = TRUE;

        if (success) AttachJRemember(globalkey, &localkey);
        else FreeJRemember(&localkey, TRUE);
    }

INPUTS
    ToKey = address of a pointer to JanusRemember structures, which
        pointer is going to receive the list pointed to by FromKey
    FromKey = address of a pointer to JanusRemember structures, which
        pointer has the list that's going to be attached ToKey,
        after which the FromKey variable will be set to NULL


RESULTS
    None
