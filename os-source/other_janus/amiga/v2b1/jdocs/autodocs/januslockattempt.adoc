NAME
    JanusLockAttempt  --  Try once to get a Janus-style lock on a byte


SYNOPSIS
    result = JanusLockAttempt(BytePtr);
    D0:0-15                   A0
        BOOL    Result;
        UBYTE   *BytePtr;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    Tries once to gets a Janus-style lock on a byte of Janus memory.

    This function performs the same function as the janusLock() function,
    except that JanusLock() will try until it succeeds, whereas
    this routine will try just once and will return a BOOL TRUE or FALSE
    to you depending on whether it was successful or not respectively.
    See the JanusLock() description for details about getting a lock
    on Janus memory.

    Note that the pointer you specify as the argument to this routine
    must point to a byte-access address space of Janus memory.

    A note for assembly language programmers:  there is a macro, named
    LOCKTRY, which performs the same function as the JanusLockAttempt()
    routine.  You should use this macro rather than make a system call
    to JanusLockAttempt().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData;
        if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK)
            {
            SData = (struct ServiceData *)MakeBytePtr(SData);
            if (JanusLockAttempt(&SData->ServiceDataLock))
                {
                /* Now the ServiceData and its memory buffers are yours
                 * to play with with impugnity.
                 */
                JanusUnlock(&SData->ServiceDataLock);
                }
            ReleaseService(SData);
            SData = NULL;
            }


INPUTS
    BytePtr = pointer to a lock byte in byte-access address space of
        Janus memory.  This byte must be initialized to 0x7F before the
        first time it's used as a lock byte


RESULTS
    result = BOOL TRUE if you got the lock, FALSE if you didn't
