NAME
    JanusUnlock  --  Release a Janus-style lock on a byte of Janus memory


SYNOPSIS
    VOID JanusUnlock(BytePtr);
                     A0
        UBYTE   *BytePtr;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    Release a Janus-style lock on a byte of Janus memory that has
    been locked via a call to JanusLock() or JanusLockAttempt().

    Note that the pointer you specify as the argument to this routine
    must point to a byte-access address space of Janus memory.

    A note for assembly language programmers:  there is a macro, named
    UNLOCK, which performs the same function as the JanusUnlock() routine.
    You should use this macro rather than make a system call to JanusUnlock().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData;
        if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK)
            {
            SData = (struct ServiceData *)MakeBytePtr(SData);
            JanusLock(&SData->ServiceDataLock);
            /* Now the ServiceData and its memory buffers are yours
             * to play with with impugnity.
             */
            JanusUnlock(&SData->ServiceDataLock);
            ReleaseService(SData);
            SData = NULL;
            }


INPUTS
    BytePtr = pointer to a lock byte in byte-access address space of
        Janus memory


RESULTS
    When control returns to you, you have released the lock
