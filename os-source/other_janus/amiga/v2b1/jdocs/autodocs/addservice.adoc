NAME
    AddService  --  Adds a Janus Service to the system


SYNOPSIS
    resultcode = AddService(
             ServiceData, AppID, LocalID, MemSize, MemType, SignalNum, Flags)
    D0:0-15  A0           D0     D1:0-15  D2:0-15  D3:0-15  D4:0-15    D5:0-15

        SHORT   resultcode;
        struct  ServiceData **ServiceData;
        ULONG   AppID;
        USHORT  LocalID;
        USHORT  MemSize;

        USHORT  Flags;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine adds a Janus service to the system.  Please refer
    to the Janus Services reference documentation for a description of
    services and adding a service to the system.

    The ServiceData argument you supply must be an address of a pointer
    to a ServiceData structure.  If the service is successfully added,
    when this call returns your pointer will point to the ServiceData
    structure of your newly-added service.  If the call fails your
    pointer will be equal to NULL.  The address, if non-NULL, will
    be an address in Janus memory's word-access address space.

    That your ServiceData is set equal to NULL if AddService() fails
    provides you with a convenient way to test whether or not you have
    to call DeleteService() during your clean-up routine.  For example:
        struct ServiceData *SData = NULL;
            result = AddService(&SData, ...);
            myExit();
        myExit()
        {
            if (SData) DeleteService(SData);
            exit(0);
        }

    The AppID, or Application ID, and LocalID that you provide are used
    by other programs to rendevous with your service.  The Application ID
    that you use should be gotten from Commodore-Amiga, Inc.
    Do not use an Application ID of your own making, for you risk a
    collision with someone else's use of the same ID number.  It's easy
    enough to get an Application ID number from Commodore, so do it.
    The LocalID is defined by you to mean anything you want it to mean.
    Anyone who wants to rendevous with your service needs to know both
    your Application ID and your Local ID.

    SignalNumber is the number of the signal bit that you will use
    to Wait() for CallService() signals.  Typically you will get
    your SignalNumber from the Exec function AllocSignal().

    The Flags argument lets you specify details about the type of service
    you want to add.  Please refer to the Janus Services reference
    documentation and the services.[hi] include file for information
    regarding the arguments that may be provided to the AddService()
    call via the Flags argument.

    This routine returns a code which is either JSERV_OK or some error-return
    code.  The codes that this routine may return are defined in
    services.[hi].

    If you call AddService() successfully, you are obliged to call
    DeleteService() sooner or later.


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a pointer to a ServiceData structure.
        After this call, the pointer will be set to either the
        word-access address of the newly-added service's ServiceData
        structure, or NULL if the call to this routine failed
    AppID = a 32-bit Application ID number for the service you want to
        add.  This number is assigned to you by Commodore-Amiga, Inc.
        REMINDER:  do not use a number of your own making, as other
        software may then invalidly rendevous with your service with results
        that make the guru giggle
    LocalID = a 16-bit Local ID number of your own choosing
    MemSize = the size of the memory block to be allocated for this
        service, if any.  Set this arg to zero if you want no memory
        allocated for this service
    MemType = the type of memory to be allocated for this service,
        if any.  If the MemSize arg above is zero, this argument is
        ignored
    SignalNumber = the number of the signal bit that you will Wait()
        on when waiting to receive CallService() signals.  The SignalNumber
        is usually gotten from a call to Exec's AllocSignal()
    Flags = flags describing any special treatment you want during
        the processing of your AddService() call.  See services.[hi] and
        the Janus Services reference document for details and definitions


RESULTS
    resultcode = a code describing the result of your call to AddService().
        This will be JSERV_OK if all went well, or some error-return
        code if the call failed for any reason.  The codes that this
        routine may return are defined in services.[hi].
