NAME
    AllocServiceMem  --  Allocate Janus memory linked to a ServiceData struct

SYNOPSIS
    MemPtr = AllocServiceMem(ServiceData, Size,   Types)
    D0,A0                    A0           D0:0-15 D1:0-15

        APTR    MemPtr;
        struct  ServiceData *ServiceData;
        USHORT  Size;
        USHORT  Types;
    From assembly, expects JanusBase in A6


FUNCTION
    This routine allocates memory for you and records the details of
    the allocation in the specified ServiceData structure, which memory,
    unless you free it explicitly with a call to FreeServiceMem(),
    will be automatically freed when the service is deleted and
    removed from the system.

    This routine calls the Janus library's AllocJRemember() call for you,
    using the ServiceData's JRememberKey field to record the parameters
    of the allocation for you.  You may then free the memory using
    the FreeServiceMem() routine.  Alternatively, you may pay no
    further attention to this memory allocation because after the
    service is deleted and all users have released it, any memory
    allocated using the ServiceData's JRememberKey will be freed
    using the FreeJRemember() function.

    You are allowed to call this routine whether you have acquired the
    ServiceData address from AddService() or GetService().

    The ServiceData structure pointer that you provide to this routine
    doesn't have to point to any particular Janus memory-access address
    space (although it must point to Janus memory of course).  What this
    means is that if you translate the ServiceData pointer you get from
    AddService() or GetService() from word-access to byte-access or
    anything else, you don't have to translate it back before calling
    AllocServiceMem().

    The Size and Type arguments are the same as those passed to the
    AllocJanusMem() function.  Please refer to the AllocJanusMem()
    documentation for a description of these arguments.

    If the call succeeds, you are returned a pointer to the Janus
    memory that you desire.  If the call fails, a NULL is returned.
    Assembly programmers note that the result is returned in both
    registers D0 and A0.


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData;
    if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK))
        {
        ptr1 = AllocServiceMem(SData, 100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_BYTEACCESS);
        ptr2 = AllocServiceMem(SData, 100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_BYTEACCESS);
AllocServiceMem                   = Page 2 =                   AllocServiceMem

        ReleaseService(SData);
        SData = NULL;
        }


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a ServiceData structure.  This may point to
        any type of Janus memory-access address, not necessarily word-access
    Size = the size in bytes of the memory allocation.  Please refer
        to the AllocJanusMem() documentation for details about this field
    Type = the type of the desired memory.  Please refer to the
        AllocJanusMem() documentation for details about this field


RESULTS
    MemPtr = a pointer to the Janus memory you've requested, or NULL
        if no memory was available.  Assembly programmers note that
        the result is returned in both registers D0 and A0
