NAME
    GetService  --  Gets a Janus Service


SYNOPSIS
    resultcode = GetService(ServiceData, AppID, LocalID, SignalNumber, Flags)
    D0:0-15                 A0           D0     D1:0-15  D2:0-15       D3:0-15

        SHORT   resultcode;
        struct  ServiceData **ServiceData;
        ULONG   AppID;
        USHORT  LocalID;
        SHORT   SignalNumber;
        USHORT  Flags;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine gets a Janus service from the system.  Please refer
    to the Janus Services reference documentation for a complete
    description of services and getting a service from the system.

    The ServiceData argument you supply must be an address of a pointer
    to a ServiceData structure.  If the service is successfully acquired,
    when this call returns your pointer will point to the ServiceData
    structure of your newly-acquired service.  If the call fails your
    pointer will be equal to NULL.  The address, if non-NULL, will
    be an address in Janus memory's word-access address space.

    That your ServiceData is set equal to NULL if GetService() fails
    provides you with a convenient way to test whether or not you have
    to call ReleaseService() during your clean-up routine.  For example:
        struct ServiceData *SData = NULL;
            result = GetService(&SData, ...);
            myExit();
        myExit()
        {
            if (SData) ReleaseService(SData);
            exit(0);
        }

    The AppID, or Application ID, and LocalID that you provide are used
    to rendevous with a service that is added by some other program.
    You must learn of the Application ID and Local ID of the service from
    the creator of the service before you can call GetService().

    SignalNumber is the number of the signal bit that you will use
    to Wait() for CallService() signals.  Typically you will get
    your SignalNumber from the Exec function AllocSignal().

    The Flags argument lets you specify details about the type of service
    you want to get.  Please refer to the Janus Services reference
    documentation and the services.[hi] include file for information
    regarding the arguments that may be provided to the GetService()
    call via the Flags argument.

    This routine returns a code which is either JSERV_OK or some error-return
GetService                        = Page 2 =                        GetService

    code.  The codes that this routine may return are defined in
    services.[hi].

    If you call GetService() successfully, you are obliged to call
    ReleaseService() sooner or later.


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a pointer to a ServiceData structure.
        After this call, the pointer will be set to either the
        word-access address of the newly-acquired service's ServiceData
        structure, or NULL if the call to this routine failed
    AppID = a 32-bit Application ID number for the service you want to find
    LocalID = a 16-bit Local ID number of the service you want to find
    SignalNumber = the number of the signal bit that you will Wait()
        on when waiting to receive CallService() signals.  The SignalNumber
        is usually gotten from a call to Exec's AllocSignal()
    Flags = flags describing any special treatment you want during
        the processing of your GetService() call.  See services.[hi] and
        the Janus Services reference document for details and definitions


RESULTS
    resultcode = a code describing the result of your call to GetService().
        This will be JSERV_OK if all went well, or some error-return
        code if the call failed for any reason.  The codes that this
        routine may return are defined in services.[hi].


BY THE WAY
    If you want to say "hi" to RJ Mical, you can try to find him at
    AppID 123, LocalID 0x8000.  If found, Forbid() (on the Amiga side),
    lock the ServiceDataLock byte, check the flags, read or write a message,
    unlock, and Permit() (on the Amiga side).  First byte in MemPtr is the
    maximum string length (don't change this field, it's read-only),
    second byte is the current string length, third byte is flags where
    bit 0 (mask 0x0001) means that this time I want you to read only.
    Check this flag ( from within Forbid()/Permit() ) every time you're
    about to write to the buffer.  All other bits of the third byte are
    reserved by me.  Fourth through n bytes are the current string.
    If you write a message, be sure to CallService(), eh?
