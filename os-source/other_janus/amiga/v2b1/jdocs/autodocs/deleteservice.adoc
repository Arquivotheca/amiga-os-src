DeleteService                     = Page 1 =                     DeleteService

NAME
    DeleteService  --  Delete a Janus Service


SYNOPSIS
    VOID DeleteService(ServiceData)
                       A0
        struct ServiceData *ServiceData;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    After you are through with a service that you have added to the
    system, you initiate the process of removing the service from
    the system by calling DeleteService().  The service will then
    be marked as SERVICE_DELETED and all users of the service will
    be signalled, at which time they are supposed to notice that
    the service has been deleted and call ReleaseService().

    After calling this routine, subsequent attempts to GetService()
    will find the service not present, and a subsequent call to
    AddService() with the same Application ID and Local ID will succeed,
    even though this particular instance of the service may not have
    been completely removed from the system yet (the service isn't
    completely removed until all users of the service have made
    the ReleaseService() call).

    If you call AddService() successfully, you are obliged to call
    DeleteService() sooner or later.

    The ServiceData structure pointer that you provide to this routine
    doesn't have to point to any particular Janus memory-access address
    space (although it must point to Janus memory of course).  What this
    means is that if you translate the ServiceData pointer you get from
    AddService() into a byte-access pointer or anything else, you don't
    have to translate it back before calling ReleaseService().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData = NULL;
        if (AddService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK)
            {
            /* Note that turning SData into a byte pointer doesn't hurt */
            SData = (struct ServiceData *)MakeBytePtr(SData);
            DeleteService(SData);
            SData = NULL;
            }


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a ServiceData structure.  This may be any
        type of Janus memory-access address, not necessarily word-access


RESULTS
    None
