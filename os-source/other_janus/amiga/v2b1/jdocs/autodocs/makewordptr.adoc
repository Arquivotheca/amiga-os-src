NAME
    MakeWordPtr  --  Make any Janus memory pointer into a word-access ptr


SYNOPSIS
    WordPtr = MakeWordPtr(OldPtr);
    D0,A0                 A0
        SHORT   *WordPtr;
        APTR    OldPtr;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine accepts a valid Janus memory pointer of any type
    and translates it into a Janus word-access address space memory
    pointer.  If you have a pointer and you don't know its type,
    or if you know the type isn't word-access and what you want is
    word-access, then this is the routine for you.

    For assembly programmers, note that the return value can be found
    in both registers D0 and A0.


INPUTS
    OldPtr = the Janus memory pointer that you want to translate


RESULTS
    WordPtr = the desired word-access memory pointer
