NAME
    CallService  --  Signal all other users of the Janus Service


SYNOPSIS
    VOID CallService(ServiceData)
                     A0
        struct ServiceData *ServiceData;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine sends a signal to the users of the service associated with
    the specified ServiceData structure.  Note that the task that calls
    CallService() will not be signalled as a result of the call.

    The ServiceData structure pointer that you provide to this routine
    doesn't have to point to any particular Janus memory-access address
    space (although it must point to Janus memory of course).  What this
    means is that if you translate the ServiceData pointer you get from
    AddService() or GetService() from word-access to byte-access or
    anything else, you don't have to translate it back before calling
    CallService().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData = NULL;
        if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK)
            {
            /* Note that turning SData into a byte pointer doesn't hurt */
            SData = (struct ServiceData *)MakeBytePtr(SData);
            CallService(SData);
            ReleaseService(SData);
            SData = NULL;
            }


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a ServiceData structure.  This may point to
        any type of Janus memory-access address, not necessarily word-access


RESULTS
    None
