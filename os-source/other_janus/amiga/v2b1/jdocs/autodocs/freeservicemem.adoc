NAME
    FreeServiceMem  --  Free mem added to a ServiceData by AllocServiceMem()

SYNOPSIS
    VOID FreeServiceMem(ServiceData, MemPtr)
                        A0           A1
        struct  ServiceData *ServiceData;
        APTR    MemPtr;
    From assembly, expects JanusBase in A6


FUNCTION
    This routine frees memory that had been allocated with a call
    to AllocServiceMem().  You can choose to free a single block of
    memory or all the memory of the ServiceData structure.

    The ServiceData structure pointer that you provide to this routine
    doesn't have to point to any particular Janus memory-access address
    space (although it must point to Janus memory of course).  What this
    means is that if you translate the ServiceData pointer you get from
    AddService() or GetService() from word-access to byte-access or
    anything else, you don't have to translate it back before calling
    FreeServiceMem().

    Note that the address of the ServiceData structure that you supply to
    this routine must be the same address that you passed to the associated
    AllocServiceMem() call, if any.

    The MemPtr argument may be one of two things:
        - the pointer to memory returned by a call to AllocServiceMem()
          (using the same ServiceData structure as the one provided to
          this call), or
        - NULL to designate that you want all (if any) of the ServiceData's
          allocated memory to be freed (note that this does not include
          freeing the memory allocated at time of AddService()

    Note that only memory allocated by AllocServiceMem can be freed.
    The memory allocated for the service during AddService() cannot be
    deleted using FreeServiceMem(), not even if you call FreeServiceMem()
    with a MemPtr argument of NULL.

    You are allowed to call this routine whether you have acquired the
    ServiceData address from AddService() or GetService().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData;
    if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK))
        {
        /* Allocate a bunch of memory */
        AllocServiceMem(SData, 100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_BYTEACCESS);
        AllocServiceMem(SData, 100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_BYTEACCESS);
        ptr1 = AllocServiceMem(SData, 100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_BYTEACCESS);

        /* Free the last one allocated */
        FreeServiceMem(SData, ptr1);

FreeServiceMem                    = Page 2 =                    FreeServiceMem

        /* Free all the rest */
        FreeServiceMem(SData, NULL);

        ReleaseService(SData);
        SData = NULL;
        }


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a ServiceData structure.  This may point to
        any type of Janus memory-access address, not necessarily word-access
    MemPtr = a pointer to the Janus memory returned by a call
        to AllocJanusMem(), or NULL if you want to delete all of the
        ServiceData's memory


RESULTS
    None
