NAME
    FreeJRemember  --  Free memory allocated by calls to AllocJRemember()

SYNOPSIS
    VOID FreeJRemember(JRememberKey, ReallyForget)
                       A0           D0:0-15
        struct  JanusRemember **JRememberKey;
        BOOL    ReallyForget;
    From assembly, expects JanusBase in A6


FUNCTION
    This function frees up Janus memory allocated by the AllocJRemember()
    function.  It will either free up just the JanusRemember structures,
    which supply the link nodes that tie your allocations together,
    or it will deallocate both the link nodes AND your memory buffers too.

    If you want to deallocate just the JanusRemember structure link nodes,
    you should set the ReallyForget argument to FALSE.  However, if you
    want FreeJRemember() to really forget about all the memory, including
    both the JanusRemember structure link nodes and the buffers allocated
    with earlier calls to AllocJRemember(), then you should set the
    ReallyForget argument to TRUE.

    Note that this routine sets your JRememberKey variable to NULL.


EXAMPLE
    struct JanusRemember *JRememberKey;
        JRememberKey = NULL;
        while (AllocJRemember(&JRememberKey, BUFSIZE, MEMF_BUFFER)) ;
        FreeJRemember(&JRememberKey, TRUE);


INPUTS
    JRememberKey = the address of a pointer to struct JanusRemember.  This
         pointer should either be NULL or set to some value (possibly
         NULL) by a call to AllocRemember()
    ReallyForget = a BOOL FALSE or TRUE describing, respectively,
         whether you want to free up only the Remember nodes or
         if you want this procedure to really forget about all of
         the memory, including both the nodes and the memory buffers
         pointed to by the nodes.

RESULT
    None
