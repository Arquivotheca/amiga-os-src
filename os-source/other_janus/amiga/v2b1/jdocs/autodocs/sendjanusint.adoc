NAME
    SendJanusInt  --  Mark a Janus system request and interrupt the PC


SYNOPSIS
    VOID SendJanusInt(JanusInterruptNumber);
                      D0
        ULONG   JanusInterruptNumber;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    The routine marks the request in the system interrupt area and then
    posts a hardware interrupt to the PC.

    This call is useful for "system" requests -- e.g. those requests
    not directly defined by the hardware.

    This is a mid-level Janus routine.  You are probably better
    served by dealing with the Janus Service routines.


INPUTS
    JanusInterruptNumber = the number of the Janus interrupt that you
        want to signal.  These are defined in services.[hi]


RESULTS
    None
