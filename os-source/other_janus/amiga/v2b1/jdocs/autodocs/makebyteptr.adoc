NAME
    MakeBytePtr  --  Make any Janus memory pointer into a byte-access ptr


SYNOPSIS
    BytePtr = MakeBytePtr(OldPtr);
    D0,A0                 A0
        BYTE    *BytePtr;
        APTR    OldPtr;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine accepts a valid Janus memory pointer of any type
    and translates it into a Janus byte-access address space memory
    pointer.  If you have a pointer and you don't know its type,
    or if you know the type isn't byte-access and what you want is
    byte-access, then this is the routine for you.

    For assembly programmers, note that the return value can be found
    in both registers D0 and A0.


INPUTS
    OldPtr = the Janus memory pointer that you want to translate


RESULTS
    BytePtr = the desired byte-access memory pointer
