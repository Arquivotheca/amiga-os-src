NAME
    AllocJRemember  --  Allocate Janus memory and link into a Remember list

SYNOPSIS
    MemPtr = AllocJRemember(JRememberKey, Size,   Types)
    D0,A0                   A0           D0:0-15 D1:0-15

        APTR    MemPtr;
        struct  JanusRemember **JRememberKey;
        USHORT  Size;
        USHORT  Types;
    From assembly, expects JanusBase in A6


FUNCTION
    This routine gets memory for you by calling the Janus library's
    AllocJanusMem() routine, but also adds the details of the allocation
    into a master list so that you make just one call the FreeJRemember()
    routine at a later time to free all the memory you allocated.
    You don't have to remember the details of all of your allocations.
    This allows you to allocate memory dynamically, as needed, without
    requiring you to undergo the bookkeeping required to free at a
    later time every last byte that you allocated.  This also allows you
    to fail part way through a series of allocations and almost
    effortlessly free up any memory you had already allocated.

    Once you get used to using this type of memory allocation, you
    never go back.

    You create the "anchor" for the allocation master list by
    declaring a variable to be a pointer to a JanusRemember
    structure.  You initialize that pointer to NULL.
    This pointer is called the JRememberKey, and is used by calls
    to AllocJRemember() and FreeJRemember().  The address of your
    pointer is passed to both AllocJRemember() and FreeJRemember().

    The Size and Type arguments are the same as those passed to the
    AllocJanusMem() function.  Please refer to the AllocJanusMem()
    documentation for a description of these arguments.

    If the call succeeds, you are returned a pointer to the Janus
    memory that you desire.  If the call fails, a NULL is returned.
    Assembly programmers note that the result is returned in both
    registers D0 and A0.

    If you have JRememberKeys from two separate calls to AllocJRemember(),
    you can merge one key into the other using the AttachJRemember()
    routine.

    This routine performs the analogy of the Intuition AllocRemember()
    call, except that it works with the special Janus memory.  For a
    complete explanation of the need for and use of Remember-style
    memory allocation and deallocation, see the Intuition reference
    manual.  For a quick overview of Intuition memory, see
    illustration 11.1 of the Intuition manual.

EXAMPLE
    struct JanusRemember *JRememberKey;
        JRememberKey = NULL;
        if (ptr = AllocJRemember(&JRememberKey, BUFSIZE, MEMF_BUFFER))
            {
            /* Use the ptr memory */
            }
        FreeJRemember(&JRememberKey, TRUE);


INPUTS
    JRememberKey = address of a pointer to JanusRemember structures.
        Before your very first call to AllocJRemember(), the pointer
        should be set to NULL.  After that, the Janus library will
        manage the contents of the pointer for you
    Size = the size in bytes of the memory allocation.  Please refer
        to the AllocJanusMem() documentation for details about this field
    Type = the type of the desired memory.  Please refer to the
        AllocJanusMem() documentation for details about this field


RESULTS
    MemPtr = a pointer to the Janus memory you've requested, or NULL
        if no memory was available.  Assembly programmers note that
        the result is returned in both registers D0 and A0
