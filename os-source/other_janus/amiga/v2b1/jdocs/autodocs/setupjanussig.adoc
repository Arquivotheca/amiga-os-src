NAME
    SetupJanusSig  --  Set up to receive a Janus interrupt from the PC


SYNOPSIS
    SetupSigPtr = SetupJanusSig(JanusInterruptNum, SignalNumber, Size, Type)
    D0,A0                       D0:0-15            D1:0-15       D2    D3

        struct  SetupSig *SetupSigPtr;
        USHORT  JanusInterruptNumber;
        USHORT  SignalNumber;
        ULONG   Size;
        ULONG   Type;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    This routine sets up an interrupt handler to receive PC interrupts
    for you.  The interrupt handler that this routine creates does all the
    underlying interrupt management for you.  When an interrupt from the
    PC arrives, the interrupt code does all the grunt work for you and
    then signals your task.  Meanwhile, you Wait() on the signal bit
    described by your SignalNumber argument, and when your task awakens
    with that bit set, voila, you've received an interrupt from the PC.
    This allows you to ignore all the complexities of writing interrupt
    code, which is very good, believe us.  If it doesn't sound as if we're
    saving you a lot of work, then you've never written interrupt code.

    You specify the JanusInterruptNumber that you want to connect with
    and the SignalNumber of the signal bit to be sent to your task.
    The Janus interrupt numbers are defined in services.[hi].
    Your signal number will most probably be gotten via a call to
    Exec's AllocSignal().

    This routine can set up a parameter area for your
    interrupt according to your specifications.  If you specify a Size
    argument of anything other than 0, then 'Size' bytes of 'Type' Janus
    memory will be allocated for you and the ss_ParamPtr field of your
    SetupSig data structure will point to the memory.

    There is some error checking being done while all this is going on.
    If SignalNumber is -1 the call fails (-1 is the error return from
    AllocSignal...).  If there is already an interrupt handler then the
    call fails.  If Size is non-zero and there is already a parameter
    area the call fails.  If it cannot allocate enough memory the call
    fails.

    If all goes well then the return value from this function a pointer
    to an initialized SetupSig structure.  This structure is defined
    in setupsig.[hi].  The call returns a NULL if an error occurs.

    This is a mid-level Janus system routine.  You would probably have
    a nicer time and be better served by using the Services routines,
    which hide all the hassle of Janus signals from you.


EXAMPLE
SetupJanusSig                     = Page 2 =                     SetupJanusSig

    struct SetupSig *sig;
    sig = SetupJanusSig(JSERV_READPC, AllocSignal(-1),
            100, MEMF_BUFFER | MEM_WORDACCESS);
    if (sig) CleanupJanusSig(sig);


INPUTS
    JanusInterruptNumber = the number of the Janus interrupt with
        which you want to connect
    SignalNumber = the number of the signal bit that your task
        will Wait() on until the PC generates your interrupt
    Size = the size of the Janus memory that you want allocated for
        your interrupt.  If 0, no memory will be allocated
    Type = the type of Janus memory you want allocated for your
        interrupt.  If Size above is 0, this argument is ignored


RESULTS
    If all goes well, returns the address of an initialized
    SetupSig structure.  If any error, returns NULL
