NAME
    JanusLock  --  Get a Janus-style lock on a byte of Janus memory


SYNOPSIS
    VOID JanusLock(BytePtr);
                   A0
        UBYTE   *BytePtr;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase


FUNCTION
    Gets a Janus-style lock on a byte of Janus memory.

    This lock cannot be achieved by both the Amiga and the PC
    simultaneously, so it's safe for the two processors to use this
    as a mechanism by which they can share memory.  By requiring
    both sides to get a lock on a certain byte of memory before
    accessing the shared memory, each can avoid interfering with
    the other's usage of the memory.

    Note that the pointer you specify as the argument to this routine
    must point to a byte-access address space of Janus memory.

    The lock byte must be initialized to 0x7F before the first time it's
    used as a lock.  After being used as a lock byte, the system manages
    the value of the byte and you should not modify it.  All lock bytes
    provided by the system (the one in the ServiceData structure, for
    instance) are initialized for you.

    Note that the lock mechanism is appropriate only for Amiga/PC locks.
    Amiga programs that wish to lock one another out of Janus memory should
    use either Forbid()/Permit() or ObtainSemaphore()/ReleaseSemaphore().

    This routine tries for the lock until it's gotten.  You may
    wish to consider using JanusLockAttempt(), which tries just once
    to get the lock.

    A note for assembly language programmers:  there is a macro, named
    LOCK, which performs the same function as the JanusLock() routine.
    You should use this macro rather than make a system call to JanusLock().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData;
        if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK)
            {
            SData = (struct ServiceData *)MakeBytePtr(SData);
            JanusLock(&SData->ServiceDataLock);
            /* Now the ServiceData and its memory buffers are yours
             * to play with with impugnity.
             */
            JanusUnlock(&SData->ServiceDataLock);
            ReleaseService(SData);
            SData = NULL;
            }

INPUTS
    BytePtr = pointer to a lock byte in byte-access address space of
        Janus memory.  This byte must be initialized to 0x7F before the
        first time it's used as a lock byte


RESULTS
    When control returns to you, you have achieved the desired lock
