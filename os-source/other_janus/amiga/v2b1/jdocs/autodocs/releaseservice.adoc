NAME
    ReleaseService  --  Release a Janus Service


SYNOPSIS
    VOID ReleaseService(ServiceData)
                        A0
        struct ServiceData *ServiceData;
    From assembly:  A6 has pointer to JanusBase

FUNCTION
    After you are through using a service or after you detect that a
    service's ServiceData structure has its SERVICE_DELETED flag set,
    you release your usage of the service by calling ReleaseService().
    After all who are attached to a service have released it, the
    service can then be removed from the system.

    If you call GetService(), you are obliged to call ReleaseService()
    sooner or later.

    The ServiceData structure pointer that you provide to this routine
    doesn't have to point to any particular Janus memory-access address
    space (although it must point to Janus memory of course).  What this
    means is that if you translate the ServiceData pointer you get from
    AddService() or GetService() from word-access to byte-access or
    anything else, you don't have to translate it back before calling
    ReleaseService().


EXAMPLE
    struct ServiceData *SData = NULL;
        if (GetService(&SData, ...) == JSERV_OK)
            {
            /* Note that turning SData into a byte pointer doesn't hurt */
            SData = (struct ServiceData *)MakeBytePtr(SData);
            CallService(SData);
            ReleaseService(SData);
            SData = NULL;
            }


INPUTS
    ServiceData = address of a ServiceData structure.  This may be any
        type of Janus memory-access address, not necessarily word-access


RESULTS
    None
