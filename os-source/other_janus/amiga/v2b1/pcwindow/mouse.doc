RE:    PCWindow Microsoft Mouse



10 May 1987


Dear Andy, Dieter, Rudolf, Henri:
Jeff Frank ("frank" on cbmvax):

I have gone as far as I can go with the Microsoft mouse code portion of 
the PCWindow program.  Now I need some help from a PC programmer.  

Here's what I've created so far:

	The key combination of Right-Amiga and SPACE toggles whether the 
	Amiga mouse is being used as a Microsoft mouse.  A menu item is 
	available to turn the Amiga mouse into a Microsoft mouse.

	With the very first Right-Amiga SPACE keystroke, a requester is 
	presented to the user as a reminder that Right-Amiga SPACE must be 
	used to turn the mouse back into an Amiga mouse.  

	When the Amiga mouse is acting as a Microsoft mouse, the Intuition 
	pointer is invisible and the PCWindow program will feed mouse 
	movement and mouse button transition events to some mouse.com program 
	running on the PC.


I need some mechanism for broadcasting this mouse activity to either the
Microsoft mouse.com program (which is the Microsoft mouse driver) or to 
some PC software that we create.

We need either:

	- a way to broadcast the mouse activity events to the Microsoft
	  mouse.com program via the serial port (as Andy suggests may be
	  possible), or

	- a way on the PC side to relay the mouse movement and button
	  transition information to the Microsoft mouse.com program, or

	- someone to create our own mouse.com program which knows how to 
	  communicate with the PCWindow program to get mouse information 
	  and which will perform all of the Microsoft mouse functions.
	  The last choice is by far the least desired.


Also, I need to be told about the current technique for an Amiga application
to establish communications with and transmit data to a PC interrupt-driven
program.

Furthermore, someone must tell me what text to use for the menu item that 
lets the user transfer mouse control to the Microsoft driver.  Specifically, 
should we use the name "Microsoft" in the menu, or what?


Please expidite this immediately if we're going to make Comdex.
