                              AutoBoot Documentation
                                 by Bill Koester

AutoBoot is system software that allows the bridgeboard to use an Amiga
file as a PC hard drive. The fake hard drive is emulated at the PC's BIOS
level for 100% compatability. To the PC the AutoBoot volume appears as a
normal PC hard drive. On the Amiga side the hard drive exists as an AmigaDos
file on any device and directory you choose. Any size PC hard drive can be
emulated as long as there is enough room for the Amiga file. This AutoBoot
file can then be used as a normal PC hard drive, it can be fdisk'ed,
formatted and made to boot the PC at power up.

SETUP:
------

To set up an autoboot volume you need to do the following:

   1). Edit your startup-sequence to include the line

            run >nil: sys:pc/pcdisk

       AutoBoot uses pcdisk to access the Amiga file so pcdisk must be
       running when the PC begins its boot procedure.

   2). Create the AutoBoot file on the Amiga. To do this use the makeab
       command included with the PCInstall disk. Decide where you want the
       file to be and issue the command

         makeab  drive:directory/filename

       makeab will now ask you for the number of heads, sectors/track, and
       number of cylinders to emulate. AutoBoot can emulate any type and
       size of PC hard drive, even hard drives that do not really exist!

       To set up a 10 meg fake drive using an Amiga Hard drive you would
       give makeab the following parameters:

       makeab  dh0:fake_c

       enter number of heads:     4
       enter sectors/track:       17
       enter number of cylinders: 306

       makeab will now print the size of the proposed file and ask you
       to accept it. You can now either restart and choose different
       parameters, or create the file. If you accept the parameters makeab
       will generate the file in the proper format for AutoBoot. Note:
       makeab creates the file FULL-SIZED and may take a while to create
       large volumes.

   3). Now that the file is created, you must tell the system where to find
       it. The system looks for the the file ABOOT.CTRL in the SYS:SIDECAR
       directory. This file should contain the full path-filename of the
       file you created with makeab. For this example you would use ed
       or a suitable editor to create the file sys:sidecar/aboot.ctrl and
       in this file there should be one line followed by a carriage return

         dh0:fake_c

       which is the name of the file just created. Save this file and you
       are now finished with work on the Amiga side. Note: You can have
       multiple AutoBoot volumes and switch between them by changing the
       contents of ABOOT.CTRL, only one AutoBoot volume can be active at
       any one time and you must reboot the Amiga to make the change active.

USE:
----

To use the AutoBoot volume from the PC you will first need to boot the
PC with a standard DOS disk. Follow the normal procedure for initializing a
PC hard drive, ie fdisk and format.

   First run fdisk on the PC the partition the fake hard drive you will
   normally use the entire disk for the DOS partition, selection 1, but
   you may also partition the hard drive in any way you like.

   Next format the fake drive using the PC format command. IF YOU WISH TO
   MAKE THE DRIVE BOOTABLE YOU MUST USE THE /S OPTION TO FORMAT. Ex

      Format c: /s

   You may now remove the floppy DOS disk and reboot the PC. The PC will now
   boot off the AutoBoot volume and you may copy files onto it and use it
   as a normal PC hard drive.

NOTE:
-----

If you have a real PC hard drive and controller installed AutoBoot will
not function!

If you AutoBoot file resides on a FastFilingSystem partition you must add
the following line to the partitions mountlist entry

   Mask = 0

Since this will slow down all file access to the partition it is recomended
that you create a separate partition for the AutoBoot file.
