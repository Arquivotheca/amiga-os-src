This disk contains software for operating the following PC emulators:

   * A1060    XT Sidecar     for the Amiga 1000
   * A2088    XT Bridgeboard for A2000/A3000 Amiga models
   * A2286    AT Bridgeboard for A2000/A3000 Amiga models

If you have not yet made a copy of this disk, DO SO NOW!

The first step in using your emulator is to install the hardware.  Follow
the hardware installation section in your users manual.  When you have
installed the hardware, move on to the software installation and subsequent
sections in the manual to use your emulator for the first time.

If you find a bug or some software/hardware combination that won't work on
the emulator we would appreciate it if you would take the time to fill out
and send in a bug report so that we may be made aware of the problem.
