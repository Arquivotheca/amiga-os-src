              JFTRANS DOCUMENTATION
            By Bill Koester


This document describes the use of the j_file_transfer() function which is
available for linking with your own programs. The j_file_transfer() function
can be used in your own C programs to transfer files to/from the PC/Amiga.
The .EXE files Aread.exe and Awrite.exe transfer files by using the
j_file_transfer() function. The source code for Aread and Awrite is provided
as an example of how to use this function.


FUNCTION:

j_file_transfer()

SYNTAX:

Error = j_file_transfer(Infile,Outfile,Direction,Mode,Transtable,Convert);

INPUTS:

char *Infile      - Pointer to NULL terminated string which is the name   of
                    the input file to open. If Direction==JFT_AMIGA_PC Infile
                    will point to string containing a valid AmigaDos
                    filespec as documented in AREAD.DOC. If Direction==
                    JFT_PC_AMIGA Infile will point to a string containing
                    a valid PC filespec as documented in AWRITE.DOC.      
char *Outfile     - Pointer to NULL terminated string which is the name of
                    the output file to open. If Direction==JFT_AMIGA_PC
                    Infile will point to a string containing a valid MS-DOS
                    filespec as documented in AREAD.DOC. If Direction==
                    JFT_PC_AMIGA Infile will point to a valid AmigaDOS
                    filespec as documented in AWRITE.DOC.
          
int  Direction    - Direction flag from jftrans.h
                    JFT_AMIGA_PC - Indicates that the transfer is from the
                    Amiga to the PC so infile will be
                    an Amiga filespec and Outfile will be
                    an MS-DOS filespec.
                    JFT_PC_AMIGA - Indicates that the transfer is from the
                    PC to the Amiga. Infile will be a MS-DOS
                    filespec and Outfile will be an Amiga
                    filespec.
int  Mode         - Mode flag from jftrans.h
                    JFT_CRLF   - Causes CRLF conversions to take place.
                    JFT_BINARY - Suppresses CRLF conversions.
char *Transtable  - Pointer to an optional character array to be used for
                    character translations. The format for the array is
                    char table[256] = {
                       0xnn,   /* Entry 0 */
                       0xnn,   /* Entry 1 */
                         .        .   
                         .        .   
                         .        .   
                       0xnn,   /* Entry 254 */
                       0xnn };   /* Entry 255 */
                    j_file_transfer() uses the following line to perform
                    its translations:
                    writechar = transtable[readchar];
                    so the input character is used as an index into the
                    table and the and the character contained in that entry
                    is the character sent as output. In this way all 255
                    ASCII characters can be converted. If a NULL is provided
                    for this field the default translation tables are used.
                    The default translations are documented in AREAD.DOC and
                    AWRITE.DOC.
int  Convert      - Conversion flag from jftrans.h
                    JFT_CONVERT   - Convert characters according to
                    Transtable provided or use defaults if NULL given as
                    Transtable.
                    JFT_NO_CONVERT - Perform no conversion of characters.
                    Character value written will be the
                    same as that read.

LINKAGE:

To use j_file_transfer() in your own programs you must link with the files
jftrans.obj and jint.obj which are provided. These object files are 
compatable with the MICROSOFT-C compiler and linker and are both compiled
with the /AL option to MSC for large model. In you program include the file
jftrans.h which provides the flag definitions and function description.
