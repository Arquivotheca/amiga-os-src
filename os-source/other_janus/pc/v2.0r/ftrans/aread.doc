                            AREAD - DOCUMENTATION
                               by Bill Koester


AREAD.EXE is a PC program that will allow you to transfer Amiga-DOS files
on the Amiga to MS-DOS files on the PC. 

The command format is:

   Aread Amiga-filespec PC-filespec [/b] [/nc]

Where:

Amiga-filespec Is any valid Amiga file specification such as df0:text,
               dh0:docs/userdocs/textfile, ram:textfile, etc.
               Note:  You must include the directory path in the filespec.
               Example: textfile is not a valid Amiga-filespec since no
               directory path is given.

PC-filespec    Is any valid MS-DOS file specification. If no directory
               path is given the file will be written to the current
               directory. See your MS-DOS users guide for a description
               of valid MS-DOS filespecs.

/b             Is an option which if given will disable LF to CRLF
               conversions. If not given the default is translate line-feeds
               to carriage-return linefeed pairs.

/nc            Is an option which if given will disable conversion of Amiga
               special characters to their corresponding MS-DOS equivilents.
               If not given the default is to convert Amiga special 
               characters to their MS-DOS equivilents.
               The character conversions performed are as follows:

		Amiga	  			PC
		Input	    is converted to	Output
		Char (Hex)			Char (Hex)
		----------			----------
		  00-7F	    No Conversion	  00-7F
		  80-A0				  7F
		  A1				  AD

		  B3-B4				  7F
		  B5				  E6
		  B6				  7F
		  B7				  F9
		  B8-B9				  7F
		  BA				  A7
		  BB				  AF
		  BC				  AC
		  BD				  AB
		  BE				  7F
		  BF				  A8
		  C0-C3				  7F
		  C4				  8E
		  C5				  8F
		  C6				  92
		  C7				  80
		  C8				  7F
		  C9				  90
		  CA-D0				  7F
		  D1				  A5
		  D2-D5				  7F
		  D6				  99
		  D7-DB				  7F
		  DC				  9A
		  DD-DE				  7F
		  DF				  E1
		  E0				  85
		  E1				  A0
		  E2				  83
		  E3				  7F
		  E4				  84
		  E5				  86
		  E6				  91
		  E7				  87
		  E8				  8A
		  E9				  82
		  EA				  88
		  EB				  89
		  EC				  8D
		  ED				  A1
		  EE				  8C
		  EF				  8B
		  F0				  EB
		  F1				  A4
		  F2				  95
		  F3				  A2
		  F4				  93
		  F5				  7F
		  F6				  94
		  F7				  F6
		  F8				  ED
		  F9				  97
		  FA				  A3
		  FB				  96
		  FC				  81
		  FD-FE				  7F
		  FF				  98
		  

Note:   The /b and /nc options work independantly of one another and either
        or both can appear on the command line in any order as long as they
        follow the Amiga and PC filespecs. Therefore it is possible to do
        CRLF translations while not converting special characters, disable
        CRLF and special character translations, etc. Also, a considerable
        speed increase can be realized by specifying both /b and /nc.


To use Aread the program PCDisk must be running on the Amiga. If PCDisk is
not running Aread will return an error message informing you of this fact.

If ARead fails for any reason one of the error codes defined in jftrans.h
will be returned as the DOS errorlevel. You can use the error return in
.BAT files to detect and handle any error that might occur.

FOR PROGRAMMERS:
----------------

Aread is implemented using the j_file_transfer command. This object module
is provided in ljanus.lib, is compatable with MICROSOFT-C 5.1 and can
be linked to your own programs. By using this object file you can also
specify your own translation tables if you need translations not available
with the standard Aread command. The source code for Aread is also provided
to give an example of using j_file_transfer. For additional information
see JFTrans.DOC.
