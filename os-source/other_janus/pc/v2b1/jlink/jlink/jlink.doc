	JLINK.COM	Virtual MSDOS Disk Support
	

	Requirements:

	    On MSDOS Side:	

		MDSOS Version 3.2
		JDISK.SYS installed via CONFIG.SYS
	    
	    On AMIGA Side:

		sidecar/pc.boot version 2.xx
		c/PcDisk running


	1. Preparing the system:

	    On MSDOS Side:

		Make sure you are running MDSOS 3.2.
		The command VER tells you what version
		you are running.

	   	Edit the CONFIG.SYS file on the boot disk:

			Add the line
			DEVICE = JDISK.SYS

		Copy the files JDISK.SYS and JLINK.COM
		to your MSDOS disk.

	    On AMIGA side:

		Edit the file s/startup-sequence:

			Add the line
			run PcDisk

		Copy PcDisk to c/PcDisk
		Copy pc.boot to Sidecar/pc.boot

		Reboot the system.

	2. Using JLINK.COM

	JLINK.COM adds four more drives to you MSDOS system.
	To obtain the new drive letters, just type JLINK with
	no arguments. It displays the four new virtual drives
	and AMIGA files that linked to them. The first time you
	are using JLINK, no drives are linked.

	General Syntax:

	JLINK [<n>:] [<amiga_file_name>] [[/<sw>]..]

	where n is the the MSDOS drive number to use,
	      amiga_file_name is a standard amiga path,
		specifying a file,
	      sw is a switch.

	switches:

		/n	- no message on completion, no
			  questions.

		/c[:n]	- create that volume on AMIGA side
			  n is the optional size in kilobytes
			  default: 32 MB

		/u      - unlink that volume

		/r	- link read only

	2.1 Creating a Virtual Volume

	Example:
		JLINK e: ram:vd /c:1000

	This example creates an AMIGA File vd on the AMIGA
	RAM disk. The file contains only the necessary MSDOS
	strutctures like File Allocation Tables and an emty
	root directory. The size of this file is appr.14 - 25 KB.
	The file grows with the data to copying to. It never
	shrinks.

	The specified size is the maximum size a volume can
	grow to. It is recommended to specify a size.
	If this number is omitted, 32MB is assumed. If the
	number is < 160 it is set to 160KB.

	After the file has been created successfully, it is
	linked to the virtual drive e: .

	If the file exists already, you are asked whether you
	want to continue, since all data on that volume are
	destroyed by CREATE.

	2.2 Linking an existing volume:

	Without any switches, a link command is assumed. You
	specify the MSDOS drive name to use and the AMIGA file
	name to link to.

	The AMIGA file must exist already.

	The /r switch can be used to link that volume Read-Only,
	all write accesses will fail.

	2.3 Unlinking a volume

	Specify the the MSDOS drive you want to unlink and
	the /u switch.

	2.4 General Hints;

	When using the /n switch, all messages except for
	errors, are suppressed. When using /n with /c, existing
	volumes are deleted without a notice.

	The AMIGA files of virtual MSDOS volumes contain no
	information that could be used on AMIGA side.
	However, the can be copied, renamed and deleted as
	usual files.

	When a file is linked to a MSDOS drive
	and written, the AMIGA DOS cannot access that file
	until it is closed by JLINK.

	The "Bytes Free" count on MSDOS DIR command represents
	the maximum size of a MSDOS volume. Of course, this
	space is limited by the physical AMIGA resources.

		
	3. Error Messages:


          "JDISK.SYS not installed"

		The driver JDISK.SYS has not been found
		at MSDOS boot time. Check the CONFIG.SYS
		file.
		
          "AMIGA Service not available"

		The program "PcDisk" is not running
		on the AMIGA side. Check the startup-
		sequence on AMIGA side.

          "AMIGA Service failed, Error %d"

		This internal error should never occur.

          "Open File %s failed"

		The requested AMIGA file could not be
		opened. It either does not exist
		or is in use already.
		
          "Syntax Error"

		Something is wrong with your command line.

          "Illegal Switch specified: %c"

		A switch was given that JLINK does not
		support.

          "JLINK Error: Drive is already linked, unlink first."

		The drive has a linked file already.

          "JLINK Error: Close Error on virtual volume."

		This error occurs if you removed the
		AMIGA diskette before unlinking the
		virtual MSDOS volume on it.

          "JLINK Error: Nothing linked."

		Attempt to unlink an empty drive.

          "Could not send a packet, error code = %X"

		Internal error, should never occur.

          "File %s exists, continue ? [Y/N]: "

		Attempt to create an existing volume.
		This message is supressed if /n switch
		is given. The program continues.

          "Write Error %X during format on drive %c:\n"

		This error can occur if the AMIGA volume
		full or has a problem.



	  If there are problems accessing a linked volume,
	  the usual MSDOS error handling takes place.

	  Accessing a drive with no volume linked generates
	  a MSDOS "Drive Not Ready" error.
