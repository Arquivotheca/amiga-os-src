Included in this directory is ARead.c, the source for the ARead command.
This source provides an example of how to use the j_file_transfer command
using ljanus.lib. If the standard conversion tables do not meet your
requirements you can use this source to make a special ARead command that
utilizes your own conversion tables. For compilation and linking information
consult the MakeFile included in this directory.
