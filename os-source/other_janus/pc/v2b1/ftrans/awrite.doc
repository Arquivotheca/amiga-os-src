                           AWRITE - DOCUMENTATION
                              by Bill Koester


AWRITE.EXE is a PC program that will allow you to transfer MS-DOS files
on the PC to AmigaDOS files on the Amiga. 

The command format is:

   Awrite PC-filespaec Amiga-filespec [/b] [/nc]

for single file transfers, or:

   Awrite PC-wild-card Amiga-Directory-Spec [/b] [/nc]   

Where:

Amiga-filespec Is any valid Amiga file specification such as df0:text,
               dh0:docs/userdocs/textfile, ram:textfile, etc.
               Note:     You must include the directory path in the filespec.
               Example: textfile is not a valid Amiga-filespec since no
               directory path is given.

PC-filespec    Is any valid MS-DOS file specification. If no directory
               path is given the file will be read from the current
               directory. See your MS-DOS users guide for a description
               of valid MS-DOS filespecs.

PC-wild-card   Is any valid MS-DOS wild card expression such as *.c
               *.*, test.*, test?.c, etc. Consult your MS-DOS users
               guide for a complete description of valid wild card
               expressions.

Amiga-Directory-Spec
               Is any valid Amiga-DOS directory specification such as
               ram:, ram:filedir/, df0:s/. Note that a valid directory
               spec must end in a : or / character. Awrite appends the
               name of the file being transfered to the directory spec
               given. Ex Awrite *.c ram: , if there is a PC file named
               test.c the output filename will be ram:test.c.


/b             Is an option which if given will disable CRLF to LF
               conversions. If not given the default is translate carriage
               return linefeed pairs to linefeeds.

/nc            Is an option which if given will disable conversion of MS-DOS
               special characters to their corresponding Amiga equivilents.
               If not given the default is to convert MS-DOS special 
               characters to their Amiga-DOS equivilents.
               The character conversions performed are documented in 
               JFTrans.doc.

Note:   The /b and /nc options work independantly of one another and either
        or both can appear on the command line in any order as long as they
        follow the Amiga and PC filespecs. Therefor it is possible to do
        CRLF translations while not converting special characters, disable
        CRLF and special character translations, etc. Also, a considerable
        speed increase can be realized by specifying both /b and /nc.


To use Awrite the program PCDisk must be running on the Amiga. If PCDisk is
not running Awrite will return an error message informing you of this fact.



FOR PROGRAMMERS:
----------------

Awrite is implemented using the j_file_transfer command. This object module
is provided in ljanus.lib, is compatable with MICROSOFT-C 5.1 and can
be linked to your own programs. By using this object file you can also
specify your own translation tables if you need translations not available
with the standard Awrite command. The source code for Awrite is also provided
to give an example of using j_file_transfer. For additional information
see JFTrans.DOC.
