;

; write after the one grabbed (and any after them, etc).  When the block
; was re-written or LooseBlocked, you'd re-add the blocks you removed after
; the block you grabbed.  This maintains the order of writes that care,
; such as directory updates, in order to make sure the disk is always
; maximally validatable (no broken chains).  The only other way to do it
; would be to use things like WriteBlockNow or WaitBlock to ensure they
; were flushed to disk, and you'd end up writing them multiple times.
