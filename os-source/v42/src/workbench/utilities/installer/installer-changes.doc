                        List of changes to Installer

Source files:
    1)  Unused source files have been deleted.
    2)  Unused routines have been removed or dropped with #if statements
    3)  Source modules have been reformated for consistant coding standards
        and for readability.  There is a standard header on the front of
        each module that describes the module and the routines in it, and
        has a change log.
    4)  All modules use a tab size of 4 characters.

installer.cd
    1)  This now works with the latest catcomp.
    2)  Various strings dealing with copy error messages have had a %s
        parameter added to describe the file name causing the error.
        Usually this was done by changing 'a file' to 'file \"%s\"'.
    3)  A couple of spelling and syntactic errors in messages were corrected.
    4)  No messages were added or deleted.

Askoptions and Askchoice
    1)  Button text longer than one line (even in topaz-8) will no longer
        render outside the window borders.  If the text is too long, it
        will be broken onto two lines.  If there is too much text for two
        lines, the remaining text will be discarded.
    2)  If more options are given than can fit on one page, multiple pages
        of option selections will be shown.  However, this should be avoided,
        since there is no indication that there are more pages to follow,
        and since you can't go back to a previous page.

Askoptions
    1)  In addition to the above, exactly 32 options now works correctly.
        Previously it would result in all options being set or clear regardless
        of actual selections.
    2)  More than 32 choices supplied is now detected as an error rather
        than causing the askoptions to return invalid results.

Exit
    1)  The user text on (exit) is now supplied on a separate window before
        the standard exit window.  This text is also logged.  This page is
        not shown if there is no user text.
    2)  The (quiet) option only suppresses the standard window, so the user
        text will still be seen.

Wrapped text
    1)  Wrapped text in things like prompt, message, abort, and similar pages
        will no longer write off the bottom of the window and crash the system
        if too much text is supplied.  However, it can still overwrite the
        gadgets at the bottom of the page and make the window very ugly.

Unwrapped text
    1)  Unwrapped text will no longer write past the borders of the window
        and crash the system.  However, any excess text is simply truncated.
        (The one exception is askchoice and askoptions button text, which
        will wrap to a maximum of two lines).

Welcome screen
    1)  The check for the presence of a (welcome) command now works, and the
        user's welcome text will be displayed in place of the default system
        welcome text.
    2)  The user's welcome text appears as the body text of the welcome page,
        rather than prepended to the help text for the page.

Getenv
    1)  If the environment variable doesn't exist (the file can't be opened)
        a good result with a null string is returned, rather than an error.

Asknumber, Askbool, and Askchoice
    1)  Coerced the default-val parameter to an integer if possible.
        This makes it work better with parameters from a getenv, which always
        returns a string, even for numeric environment variables.

Asknumber
    1)  If a range parameter is not given so that the implied range is
        only non-negative numbers, and the default value supplied is negative,
        the range will be extended downward to include the default value.

Default installation location
    1)  Previously Installer could install to RAM: by default.  There is
        now a kludge to prevent this, although the logic can still be
        improved greatly.

Copyfiles
    1)  A system crash if a pattern is given with a fully qualified file
        name is fixed.
    2)  Most copy failures (possibly all) will now show the name of the
        file that had the problem.

Tooltype
    1)  Changed to force all tool names to uppercase to eliminate case
        sensitivity problems.
    2)  Documented that (settooltype) can have one or two arguments.

Listed bugs fixed:
    1)  B15450
    2)  B16639
    3)  B17673  (unable to duplicate -- works for me!)
    4)  B17674  (also documented how settooltype really works)
    5)  B17840
    6)  B18729  (text will be truncated or wrapped)
    7)  B18768
