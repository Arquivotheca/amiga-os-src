Release Notes:

CrossDOSFileSystem 40.19 to 40.22
=================================

Releases 40.20 and 40.21
------------------------
Internal.

Default disk icon.
------------------
Fixed small obscure bug when determining if the default disk.info
is needed.

High-density format
-------------------
Fixed  a small problem when formatting a high-density disk.  Some
PC  systems  did  not recognize the format we placed on the disk.
Many  other  PC  systems  accepted  the  disk with no complaints.
Changed  the format parameters to one accepted by all(?) systems.
I  am cautious about the term "all" in the previous sentence.  My
experience  seems to indicate the the term "MS-DOS compatibility"
is just short of being an oxymoron.
