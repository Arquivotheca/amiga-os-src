This directory currently contains a binary for a version of CrossDOS which
is post-3.1. The binary is in the root, and the RCS directory contains the
files that have changed since the final 3.1 release.

To get the full source for 40.22, just make a copy of the RCS contents,
copy the 3.1 RCS directory in this directory, and copy the 40.22 RCS files on
top of the freshly copied 3.1 RCS files.
